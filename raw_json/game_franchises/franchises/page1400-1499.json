Though Daisuke Ishiwatari helped with the game's production, the lion's share of the work was done by <a href=\"/toshimichi-mori/3040-98228/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-98228\">Toshimichi Mori</a>.</p><h2>Story</h2><h3>Calamity Trigger</h3><p>Many years ago, a large being appeared known only as \"The Black Beast.\" It ravaged the entire world, leaving destruction in its wake. All conventional weapons were useless against it, and even nuclear bombs proved to be useless against this strange new threat. But one day, a legendary band of warriors known collectively as \"The Six Heroes,\" wielding magic and special weaponry, rose to fight the Black Beast and bring peace to what was left of humanity.</p><p>In the aftermath, the Novus Orbis Librarium (\"The Library\" or the NOL) united most of humanity under a single government, and organized the construction of \"Hierarchical Cities\" at high elevations. The death of the Black Beast covered most of the world in \"seithr,\" a magical energy that could be used to power magic and technology, but at the same time too much exposure could cause living things to go insane or even die, so these cities were built at high elevations, on mountains, and similar formations.</p><p>There was a relative period of peace, but soon a faction emerged that sought independence from the rule of the Library. The Federation led by the city of Ikaruga ended up fighting in a civil war with the Library, but the city was mercilessly wiped out by NOL forces, and the survivors scattered to the other cities.</p><p>Now in the present, in the 13th Hierarchical City of Kagutsuchi, a notorious SS-class criminal known as \"Ragna the Bloodedge\" has reportedly set his sights on destroying the main NOL branch there, just as he has in other cities around the world. This has sparked bounty hunters and soldiers of all kinds to flock to the city. Some seek the massive bounty his capture would bring, others seek the \"Azure Grimoire\" (or BlazBlue) that Ragna supposedly holds, an artifact that contains immense magical power to anyone who wields it, and still others have their own reasons for coming to the city.</p><h3>Continuum Shift</h3><p>Noel Vermillion has been revealed as the true holder of the Azure Grimoire, but Hazama appeared at the last moment to steal it from her. While Ragna and Jin nurse their respective wounds, the major players suddenly take an interest in Noel as Hazama seeks to turn her back into Mu-12. Meanwhile, Rachel is having issues dealing with a highly advanced AI that has been resetting the flow of time over and over, Tsubaki is wrestling with her duty to the Imperator over being ordered to kill her dear friends Noel and Jin, Hakumen is being kept prisoner and Kokonoe prepares her contingency plan should things go wrong.</p><h3>Chrono Phantasma</h3><p>A handful of powerful factions within the NOL begin to break away from the Imperator as Kagura Mutsuki secretly prepares to install the surviving heir to the scattered nation of Ikaruga as the new leader. Meanwhile, Sector Seven grows weary of Kokonoe's actions and thaws out an unstoppable berserker to deal with her. Elsewhere, Rachel attempts to organize a small band of fighters to deal with the true threat the Imperator poses to the world. However, the Imperator and her servants prove to be a difficult challenge, and Izanami partially succeeds in its goal of drowning the world in seithr, making Ragna and his siblings' efforts to stop Take-Mikazuchi into a somewhat pyrrhic victory.</p><h3>Central Fiction</h3><p>While Kagura attempts to consolidate the remnants of the Library around his chosen heir, a giant egg appears in the sky created by Izanami, the displaced Imperator. As the egg hatches, Ragna suddenly finds himself teleported back to the past, where only he remembers recent events, while everyone else seems to be acting slightly different.</p><h2>Main Games</h2><h3>BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger</h3><p>The game that started it all. Only ten characters were playable in this version, including the final boss character <a href=\"/v-13/3005-11515/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11515\">v-13</a> (pronounced \"Nyu,\" as in the 13th Greek letter).</p><h3>BlazBlue: Continuum Shift</h3><p>This game continued off the story from the first game and added two new playable characters to the mix: <a href=\"/tsubaki-yayoi/3005-12480/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-12480\">Tsubaki Yayoi</a> and <a href=\"/hazama/3005-11516/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11516\">Hazama</a>. A third, Mu-12, could be unlocked after beating the Story mode. Also, the burst and guard systems were tweaked a bit.</p><h3>BlazBlue: Continuum Shift II</h3><p>Technically a patch for the previous game (and was a downloadable patch for the console versions) but released as a brand new title on the PSP and Nintendo 3DS. This version also introduced three more playable characters that could be downloaded for a price or patched in for free to play against online: <a href=\"/makoto-nanaya/3005-13475/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-13475\">Makoto Nanaya</a>, <a href=\"/valkenhayn-hellsing/3005-15849/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-15849\">Valkenhayn R. Hellsing</a>, and <a href=\"/platinum-the-trinity/3005-15848/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-15848\">Platinum the Trinity</a>.</p><h3>BlazBlue: Continuum Shift Extend</h3><p>This one contained all previous playable characters for no extra charge and added one more: <a href=\"/relius-clover/3005-16619/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-16619\">Relius Clover</a>. Technically another expansion pack and patch to BB:CS, but released as its own retail copy instead with a couple new modes attached: Unlimited Mars mode, forcing the player to fight a string of Unlimited-powered AI opponents with no continues, and Abyss mode which added RPG elements to the normal fighting game as the player took one character down a set number of levels depending on selected difficulty.</p><p>In addition, the story mode included paths for the new characters not mentioned in the original Continuum Shift, and offered a truncated story of Calamity Trigger with new cutscenes animated by <a href=\"/nitroplus/3010-6446/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6446\">Nitroplus</a>.</p><h3>BlazBlue: Chrono Phantasma</h3><p>A true sequel to the events of Continuum Shift. This game was released only for the PS3 and PS Vita, as Mori claimed that the size limitations of XBOX 360 discs made it difficult to release the game for that system without removing some content.</p><p>Chrono Phantasma included seven new playable characters, including two who would later be added as DLC: <a href=\"/yuki-terumi/3005-32917/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-32917\">Yuki Terumi</a> (the original version of <a href=\"/hazama/3005-11516/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11516\">Hazama</a>) and <a href=\"/kokonoe/3005-15004/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-15004\">Kokonoe</a>. Gameplay-wise, the guard-break system was completely overhauled from Continuum Shift and a new system called \"Overdrive\" was introduced, allowing a character to sacrifice a burst each round in order to briefly extend combos or make their Distortion Drives even stronger, which could result in an \"Overdrive Finish\" if the enemy was successfully KO'd with one.</p><p>Rather than focus on each character's story individually as done in previous games, the story mode largely split into three sections: Chronophantasma, Six Heroes, and Sector Seven. The three branches would later unite into one path for the True Ending of the story, which brought the protagonists together to fight a rampaging Take-Mikazuchi called down by the Imperator herself.</p><p>The game also introduced fake arcade lobbies online, which allowed players to meet up in giant rooms where they could challenge one-another by having their avatar sit at a machine across from the player they wished to play, simulating a local arcade experience. Some lobbies offered special prizes for avatars or flags.</p><h3>BlazBlue: Chrono Phantasma Extend</h3><p>An expansion of the previous game released in the summer of 2015. This game included a playable <a href=\"/celica-a-mercury/3005-31214/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-31214\">Celica A.

Pixel can jump on enemies' heads, killing them and building up a meow-meter, which (upon being filled) allows Pixel to unleash a devastating meow.<br/><br/>PIXEL!'s key gameplay twist is that, at many points in the game the player will be required to \"zoom in\" to the individual pixels by holding the left trigger, and then examining them in order to perform a task (e.g. chopping down a tree, killing a guard dog). In addition to these required areas, there are three collectibles per level that the player can unlock by zooming in on specially marked blocks.<br/><br/><h3>Arkedo Series - 04 SLASH!</h3><br/>The fourth game in the Arkedo Series has been announced, although there is little information regarding it.

The only penalty incurred is that any equipment you were currently wearing were lost, but in Rengoku 2 even that penalty is diminished by allowing you to return to where you died and get your equipment back. The exception is if you die during a floor boss, in which case you get to keep your equipment.</p><p>A peculiarity of the series is that the two titles differ tremendously in quality, aside from the sequel adding things to the formula.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p>The story in each title is standalone rather than one being a continuation of the events of the other. However it can be speculated that the two games take place in the same fictional universe.</p><h4>Rengoku's story</h4><p>Androids fight in a combat arena originally intended to serve as entertainment for human spectators. The combat program still runs autonomously, forcing androids to fight each other, and recreating them each time they are defeated so they can fight again. You play as an android that has became self-aware and questions the reason for the his and the arena's existence. He hopes to reach the top of the tower in order to find answers.</p><h4>Rengoku 2's story</h4><p>A virtual reality combat program was created in order to create an AI for an ultimate fighting android, using the memories of human soldiers who died. Beatrice, the scientist who runs the program discovers that her fallen lover, Gram, is one of the people whose memories was placed inside the program.</p><p>It is later revealed that Gram died while his team was using experimental AI cell combat suits, which led to a team member betraying and killing some of the other members in order to gain control of all the AI cells. This led the remaining members to turn on each other, resulting in a bloodbath.
