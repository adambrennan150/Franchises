The books began as a sort of parody of other fantasy works, as well as mythology, history, folklore, and fairy tales. However, over the years they have taken on a lore all of their own, with running gags, returning characters and a very distinctive style. Regardless of this, each book is designed to stand alone. A prominent feature of the franchise is that they contain satirical parallels to our real world, science, culture and religion.</p><p>Terry Pratchett is also an avid video game fan and has taken the opportunity throughout the years to translate the Discworld to the medium of gaming, starting with the earliest in 1986, The Colour of Magic for the home computers. Most of these projects, however, have featured plots entirely new, and not based on a particular novel such as the more recent <a href=\"/discworld-noir/3030-4203/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4203\">Discworld Noir</a> for <a href=\"/pc/3045-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a> which features the brand new character <a href=\"/lewton/3005-4975/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4975\">Lewton</a> the private detective.</p><p>Most of the stories of Discworld are set on the titular world shaped like a disc. The disc itself rests upon the backs of four huge elephants which in turn are standing on the back of an enormous turtle, the Great A'Tuin. The turtle slowly swims forward through space and does not revolve around a Sun, instead, it has a tiny sun (and moon) orbiting it.</p><p>The world is populated with humans, trolls, dwarfs and other kinds of beings. It contains several different distinct cultures, magic and it's own set of physical laws. Perhaps the most prominent and revered of the characters on the Discworld is <a href=\"/death/3005-955/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-955\">Death</a> who generally shows up when someone is dead, or at least when he thinks that they ought to be, and otherwise, can be seen only by wizards and cats.</p>", "guid": "3025-836", "name": "Discworld"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-837", "name": "Esper Dream"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-838", "name": "Hoyle"}, {"description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Digimon (short for Digital Monster) created by Akiyoshi Hongo.

Designed as a follow up to the successful <a data-ref-id=\"3025-56\" href=\"/beatmania/3025-56/\" slug=\"beatmania\">Beatmania</a> franchise, the series builds upon the foundation created and adds in numerous additions to gameplay and content. IIDX game are initially released as Arcade games (Often referred to as AC releases), but since <a data-ref-id=\"3030-22323\" href=\"/beatmania-iidx-3rd-style/3030-22323/\" slug=\"beatmania-iidx-3rd-style\">IIDX 3rd Style</a>, have also been released on the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-19\" href=\"/playstation-2/3045-19/\" slug=\"playstation-2\">Playstation 2</a> (Known as a CS release).<br/><h2>Gameplay</h2>IIDX is played using seven keys, arranged in a keyboard-like fashion, with four lower white keys and three higher black keys, and a turntable that can be rotated clockwise or counter clockwise. In a similar fashion to the original Beatmania series, coloured lines, also known as notes, descend to the bottom of the screen and have to be pressed as they pass by a target area. Notes are arranged in specific patterns according to the song being played. Depending on how accurately the player hits the correct button, they are given a judgment level for each note and the corresponding number of points. By hitting a note on time, a small part of the song is played. Hitting multiple notes combines the key sounds together to form the whole song. The turntable is used in a similar fashion to the buttons, with a larger red line being used to indicate when the player needs to move the turntable. For fast sections of 'scratching', the player needs to move the turntable in one direction and then the other in order to sucessfully hit the notes.<br/><br/>In standard play, Beatmania IIDX judges whether or not a player passes based on the percentage of their groove gauge that is left. As each song is played, any missed notes deduct a portion of the players groove gauge, whilst hitting sucessive notes on time increases the gauge back again. The player has to finish a song with the groove gauge at over 80% to pass, but the gauge can empty completely in standard play without causing a game over to occur. A game over will only occur during standard play in the Arcade releases, where a series of successive misses will cause the game to automatically stop, or when the gauge reaches 0% with the hard modifier on or in Dan mode.<br/><br/>Different modes and modifiers can be used to change how the game plays:<br/><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>Standard/Arcade: The player can freely choose unlocked songs to play on varying difficulty levels, and after three songs (Potentially more if the player scores well), an overall judgement of how well the player has performed is given and the game ends.</li> <li>Expert: The player is given a choice of several set lists of songs to play, called courses; songs are played one after the other on a difficulty of the players choice, and they are given a full groove gauge at the start of the first song. As the player misses notes, the groove gauge becomes emptier, and if it reaches 0%, the player loses the course. This is very similar to the Hard modifier that can be used on any song in Standard mode. Refilling the groove gauge is a lot harder than normal in Expert mode.</li> <li>Class/Dan: The player is again given another list of preset songs to play one after the other, except unlike Expert mode, they cannot choose the difficulty to play the songs on. Class play orders the set lists of songs in order of difficulty. Acting as tests of a players skill, a player can see what the highest class they are able to pass is, and can then use that to compare their abilities to other players.</li> <li>Free Mode: In Arcade versions of IIDX, Free mode allows the player to choose what songs they want to play, but does not fail the player at the end of the song regardless of how well they do. The player, however, has one less song per turn because of this. On home versions, Free mode just allows the user to play as many songs as they want.</li> </ul>", "guid": "3025-853", "name": "beatmania IIDX"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-854", "name": "Pajama Sam"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-855", "name": "beatmania III"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-856", "name": "Anno"}, {"description": "<p>The World Snooker Championship franchise started with World Championship Snooker on the Playstation and PC back in 2000 and is the official game franchise of the World Snooker Championship.\u00a0 The games have always been developed by Blade Interactive Studios and were initially published by Codemasters untill after the 2004 version of the game when puiblishing moved to Sega Europe.<br/><br/>In 2004 the name of the franchise was changed to World Snooker Championship to better reflect the name of the sports tournament body and the actual snooker tournament held every year at the Crucible in Sheffield, England.<br/><br/>In 2005 the games box art featured the snooker player Paul Hunter who sadly died in 2006, aged just 27, after a battle with cancer.\u00a0 When the game was re-released as a budget title from Sold-out Software, his image and likeness remained on the cover and in the game but with a notice on the back of the box \"Paul Hunter 1978 - 2006\".<br/><br/>The 2007 version of the game was the first World Snooker game to also feature fully licensed Pool tournaments alongside the snooker ones.\u00a0 Previous versions of the game had pool only as a side game you could play in single matches against the computer or in multiplayer.\u00a0 In the 2007 version of the game you could start a career playing only pool tournaments, cutting out snooker altogether.<br/><br/>In September 2008 the latest game in the franchise is due to be released WSC Real 08: World Snooker Championship.\u00a0 It\u00a0 will see the release of the franchise on the Wii for the first time and will come with a case containing a cue attachment for the Wii-mote.\u00a0 It will also be the first PC version of the title to be released since 2005.</p>", "guid": "3025-857", "name": "World Snooker Championship"}, {"description": "<p>Kunio-Kun was a long running videogame franchise created by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-452\" href=\"/technos-japan-corp/3010-452/\" slug=\"technos-japan-corp\">  Technos</a> in 1986.

However, it did not appear outside of Japan until the <a href=\"/nintendo-ds/3045-52/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-52\">Nintendo DS</a> release in 2005. The first 3 games of the franchise were also released with touched up artwork as an <a href=\"/gyakuten-saiban-123-hd/3030-37357/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-37357\">HD Collection</a> on both iTunes and Google Play, which later saw a port to the 3DS.</p><p>An Ace Attorney game typically consists of a number of different episodes where the player must investigate and defend their client in court, striving to achieve the \"Not Guilty\" verdict. There are 9 games in the franchise, 6 in the main series (Ace Attorney) a Meiji era Japan spin-off (Dai Gyakuten Saiban), and 2 with a slightly different style of gameplay (Ace Attorney Investigations). Additionally, <a href=\"/level-5-inc/3010-1659/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1659\">Level-5</a> teamed up with Capcom to make the crossover game <a href=\"/layton-kyouju-vs-gyakuten-saiban/3030-32927/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-32927\">Professor Layton VS Ace Attorney,</a> which released in late 2012 in Japan and 2014 in other territories.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>In the Ace Attorney games, each chapter is split into two sections: <b>Investigation</b> and <b>Trial</b>. A chapter typically rotates between the two phases within the span of 2 to 3 days, and culminates with the verdict given by the judge.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14097/606860-06.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-606860\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14097/606860-06.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-606860\"><img alt=\"Talking to the Defendent\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/14097/606860-06.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/14097/606860-06.jpg 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></a><figcaption>Talking to the Defendent</figcaption></figure><p>In the investigation phase, players travel to various areas related to the case and gather evidence by examining areas for clues and talking to other characters for information.

Apollo Justice, however, introduced a new game mechanic, Apollo\u2019s Bracelet. This lets the players detect any unusual body language from the witness and press them on it.

Unlike the previous games, the player has direct control over Edgeworth, moving him with either the D-pad or the stylus. All characters now have walking sprites and animation, as opposed to simply having portraits of their upper body. The trial portions of the game are removed entirely, replaced with a similar Argument/Rebuttal phase outside of the courtroom. The investigations themselves play out similar to in previous games, but there are new features added. One of these is the \"Logic System\", in which players receive a number of bits of information over the course of the case, and have to connect pieces together to gain new insight.</p><h2>Development</h2><p>The series started as Gyakuten Saiban on the Game Boy Advance in Japan and was later ported to the DS and released worldwide. It was created at Capcom Production Studio 4 by game designer and writer <a href=\"/shu-takumi/3040-32922/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-32922\">Shu Takumi</a>. Takumi was responsible for the story in the main franchise up Apollo Justice, but wass not involved in the Ace Attorney Investigations games or <a href=\"/phoenix-wright-ace-attorney-dual-destinies/3030-37354/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-37354\">Dual Destinies</a>. He, however, will be involved in <a href=\"/layton-kyouju-vs-gyakuten-saiban/3030-32927/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-32927\">Professor Layton VS Ace Attorney</a>.</p><p>During development of the American release, other names were considered instead of \"Ace Attorney\". Some of the staff members thought the \"Ace\" sounded too childish, and some wanted \"Action Attorney\". In the end, they all settled upon the use of \"Ace Attorney\". The earlier games are also known for their spelling/grammar errors, which was unusual for high-profile games by that time. The localization also features voices from Capcom's own localization team, including <a href=\"/ben-judd/3040-58539/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-58539\">Ben Judd</a> as Phoenix himself.</p><p>The series is distinct for having different composers for every game in the franchise. The first game is composed by then new composer <a href=\"/masakazu-sugimori/3040-93836/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-93836\">Masakazu Sugimori</a>, the second by <a href=\"/naoto-tanaka/3040-37169/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-37169\">Naoto Tanaka</a>, the third by veteran <a href=\"/noriyuki-iwadare/3040-3000/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-3000\">Noriyuki Iwadare</a>, and Apollo Justice by Toshiko Horiyama. The Ace Attorney Investigations games, however, breaks the mold by using Iwadare for both games, who later returned once again for Dual Destinies.</p><h2>Arranged Soundtracks</h2><p>Capcom has released several arrange albums for the franchise.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1081/2225957-folder.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2225957\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.988\" data-width=\"500\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:98.8%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1081/2225957-folder.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2225957\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/1081/2225957-folder.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/1081/2225957-folder.jpg 500w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/1081/2225957-folder.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/1081/2225957-folder.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/1081/2225957-folder.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/1081/2225957-folder.jpg 500w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/1081/2225957-folder.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/1081/2225957-folder.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p><b>Gyakuten Saiban Meets Orchestra</b> is an synthesized orchestrated album with songs from the main series of games.
