The video itself adjusts its playback to match the train's actual speed, with audio mixed-in separately. This technique was later used for numerous other train driving simulators, including Unten Douraku, Hassha Yoshi, and <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/japanese-rail-sim-3d/3025-3830/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-3830\">Testudou Nippon</a>.</p><p>Gameplay-wise, Train Simulator has players driving a train through each section of the route using a simplistic set of controls (a multi-stage throttle lever and a multi-stage brake lever, both of which can be combined into a single set of controls). Along with free-form driving through the unlocked sections, players can unlock additional sections by playing through each game's \"Exam\" mode, which tasks them with additional restrictions (such as following both the speed limit and strict timetable and following strict guidelines for stopping the train at the platform). Each game also has bonus travel information about each station, the railway itself, and surrounding areas, as well as a <a href=\"/quiz/3015-5714/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5714\">quiz mini-game</a>.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/466/604380-930090_20060921_screen001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-604380\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/466/604380-930090_20060921_screen001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-604380\"><img alt=\"One of the later games in the series, showing a fullscreen video with the cab interior superimposed on top of it.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/466/604380-930090_20060921_screen001.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/466/604380-930090_20060921_screen001.jpg 1024w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/0/466/604380-930090_20060921_screen001.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/466/604380-930090_20060921_screen001.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/466/604380-930090_20060921_screen001.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>One of the later games in the series, showing a fullscreen video with the cab interior superimposed on top of it.</figcaption></figure><p>The series primarily focuses on particular railway lines throughout <a href=\"/japan/3035-37/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-37\">Japan</a>, with some entries including multiple lines and some entries including overseas lines (such as the <a href=\"/train-simulator-german-railway-rhine-river-left-ba/3030-34357/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-34357\">West Rhine Railway</a> in <a href=\"/germany/3035-281/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-281\">Germany</a>, the <a href=\"/train-simulator-south-france/3030-34356/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-34356\">Marseille-Ventimiglia Railway</a> in <a href=\"/france/3035-197/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-197\">France</a>, the <a href=\"/railfan/3030-23560/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-23560\">CTA Brown Line</a> in the <a href=\"/the-united-states-of-america/3035-396/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-396\">United States</a>, and the <a href=\"/railfan-taiwan-high-speed-rail/3030-27397/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-27397\">Taiwan High Speed Rail</a> in <a href=\"/taiwan/3035-2638/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2638\">Taiwan</a>).

The studio previously used the video synchronization technology for the multimedia project \"Touch the Music by Casiopea\". Earlier games in the series had Mukaiya's name on the box art as the game's \"director\", and had him voice the game's mascot (a train driver bearing his resemblance). Music from the band were also used in some of the series' later entries (most notably <a href=\"/train-simulator-real-the-yamanote-line/3030-34348/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-34348\">Train Simulator Real: The Yamanote-sen</a>).</p><p>After the release of the series' PS3 entries (<a href=\"/railfan/3030-23560/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-23560\">Railfan</a> and <a href=\"/railfan-taiwan-high-speed-rail/3030-27397/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-27397\">Railfan: Taiwan High Speed Rail</a>), Ongakukan ceased working on consumer train driving simulation games and instead focused on large-scale train driving simulators (for exhibitions and training), automated train platform doors, and train departure melodies.

Five blights have occurred so far and all have ended with the archdemon being slain by a Grey Warden.</p><h3>Magic</h3><p>Magic is a more complex subject in Dragon Age than most franchises. Living the life of a mage involves hatred, <a href=\"///\">slavery</a> and fear of possession by otherworldly beings. Magic and mages are stuck between being essential to society yet being looked on with disgust by the omnipresent religious authorities.</p><p>Mages have a link to <a href=\"///\">The Fade</a>, the first realm created by The Maker (creator of all life in the Dragon Age universe) in which spirits and demons live. The Fade and Thedas are connected by a barrier known as The Veil. It is The Fade itself that mages use to cast magic but it is also how they can be possessed by demons if they are not mentally strong enough. Mages possessed by demons are known as Abominations.</p><h3>Fantasy Medieval Period</h3><p>The world of Dragon Age is very much a world of swords, shields, honor and greed. Generals of armies are celebrated as heroes by the very people whose human rights they violate on a daily basis. <a href=\"///\">Elves</a> have an affinity to forests and <a href=\"///\">Dwarves</a> to the ground.</p><h2>Game Play</h2><h3>Combat</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1445279-daorigins_2010_07_19_18_22_34_54.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1445279\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"1440\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1440px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1445279-daorigins_2010_07_19_18_22_34_54.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1445279\"><img alt=\"The traditional CRPG gameplay of Dragon Age: Origins\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1445279-daorigins_2010_07_19_18_22_34_54.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/6/62890/1445279-daorigins_2010_07_19_18_22_34_54.jpg 1440w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/6/62890/1445279-daorigins_2010_07_19_18_22_34_54.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/6/62890/1445279-daorigins_2010_07_19_18_22_34_54.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1445279-daorigins_2010_07_19_18_22_34_54.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The traditional CRPG gameplay of Dragon Age: Origins\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1445279-daorigins_2010_07_19_18_22_34_54.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/6/62890/1445279-daorigins_2010_07_19_18_22_34_54.jpg 1440w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/6/62890/1445279-daorigins_2010_07_19_18_22_34_54.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/6/62890/1445279-daorigins_2010_07_19_18_22_34_54.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1445279-daorigins_2010_07_19_18_22_34_54.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The traditional CRPG gameplay of Dragon Age: Origins</figcaption></figure><p>Dragon Age games are traditionally <a href=\"/real-time-combat/3015-2332/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2332\">real-time</a> party-based RPGs (with the exception of the <a href=\"/turn-based/3015-192/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-192\">turn-based</a> web-browser game Dragon Age: Journeys) in which players must <a href=\"/micromanagement/3015-76/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-76\">micromanage</a> the party with an emphasis on pausing the game to evaluate situations, take control of specific players and cast spells on various enemies.

They have united as a race only four times: the first four Blights. The rich and poor alike are split between honorable and greedy, one of the contributing factors to why Ferelden was conquered and ruled for so long by Orlais. The largest human empire to have existed was the Tevinter Imperium at the height of its power.</p><p>After the loss of much of the Imperium's power by the uprising led by the prophet Andraste, The Chantry was formed in her name. The Chantry and its worship of The Maker and Andraste began to play a more important part in society than politics. Even Kings are now bound by the rules of The Chantry and their feared Exalted Marches against their enemies.</p><h3>Elves</h3><p>The <a href=\"/elf/3015-537/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-537\">Elves</a> of lore were once immortal and they would never die, save for specific rituals in which those tired of life would enter a deep state of sleep, sometimes to never awake. It was discovered that contact with humans was damaging the race in two ways. The first was that contact with humans caused elves to age and die; secondly, Elf and Human interbreeding only produced human offspring.</p><p>Through the two long periods of enslavement by the Tevinter Imperium and The Chantry they had lost their immortality, their Gods (the Elven Pantheon) and their heritage. Today elves exist in two groups: the Dalish Elves, who live to regain all which they lost; and City Elves, who choose life in human cities as second-class citizens. The Dalish chose to roam the lands under the rule of no-one until the day they have their own land once again. They are extremely hostile towards humans and seek to be left in peace. The City Elves live in poverty and work for low pay under humans. In some lands the Elven Slave Trade is still active in secrecy.</p><h3>Dwarfs</h3><p>Dwarven society has many differences from Humans and Elves in the Dragon Age franchise. Due to a natural resistance to magic, <a href=\"/dwarves/3015-940/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-940\">Dwarves</a> are unable to become Mages. Because of this, as well as their lack of a link to The Fade, they don't worship The Maker; rather they worship their own ancestors and the stone in which they are said to return to when they die.</p><p>Society is split into Houses (extended family) and Castes (jobs). The Royal family is the highest house and the lowest of the low are caste-less, the poverty stricken and thieves.</p><h3>Qunari</h3><p><a href=\"/qunari/3015-6613/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6613\">The Qunari</a> are physically imposing people with views on life that are just as harsh. They don't view aspects of Human, Elven and Dwarven society as necessary. Everything they do is to improve and maintain the species as a collective. Those in charge of goods don't sell them, they make sure they're distributed evenly throughout. Qunari job titles are not viewed as their literal names, but their identity as a whole. It is their usefulness that defines them, not any meaningless name given to them at birth.</p><p>Qunari practice the ultimate form of natural selection, breeding children for specific roles so that they can be as much use to society as possible. The majority of Qunari are born with horns, those who are not are no more or less accepted by society as they're still just as capable of performing their duties.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2487/1555970-qunari_mage_handler.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1555970\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.61216216216216\" data-width=\"740\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 740px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:61.2%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2487/1555970-qunari_mage_handler.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1555970\"><img alt=\"The Qunari\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/2487/1555970-qunari_mage_handler.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/2487/1555970-qunari_mage_handler.jpg 740w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/2487/1555970-qunari_mage_handler.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/2487/1555970-qunari_mage_handler.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Qunari\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/2487/1555970-qunari_mage_handler.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/2487/1555970-qunari_mage_handler.jpg 740w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/2487/1555970-qunari_mage_handler.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/2487/1555970-qunari_mage_handler.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Qunari</figcaption></figure><p>Qunari Mages however, as with anything to do with magic, are considered defects. They are caged when they are not fighting and never go anywhere without their handler (arvaarad in the Qunari language) when they are. Any mages suspected of wrong doing, performing spells they shouldn't or having dealings with demons, have their tongues cut out so that they are never able to do any harm or influence any of the other mages.</p><p>A common misconception of the Qunari is that the name refers to the species itself, but any followers of the religion known as The Qun, human, elven or dwarven, can also be called a Qunari. The species itself knows their name but do not speak of it to others, as it is viewed as meaningless as their aforementioned forenames.</p><h3>Dragons</h3><p><a href=\"/dragons/3015-551/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-551\">Dragons</a> grow from Dragonlings, to <a href=\"/drakes/3015-5762/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5762\">Drakes</a> (male) in which they lose their forelimbs and to Dragons (female) who grow an extra pair of limbs for wings. At this point the females are still immature, their fully grown form is that of a high dragon. The Drakes fight with each other for the right to mate with the High Dragon. The High Dragon then goes on one of its well-known rampages before returning to its lair to prepare for the birth of its offspring.</p><h3>Wolves and Werewolves</h3><p>While <a href=\"/wolf/3015-2265/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2265\">wolves</a> are very much standard wolves seen in fictional tales, films and TV shows, the Dragon Age version of werewolves are unique. It is said that when a wolf is possessed by a Rage Demon, it becomes a werewolf, attacking all in an unending fury, spreading its disease and causing transformations as other fictional werewolves traditionally do.</p><p>Another form of werewolves are created by the Dalish Elf <a href=\"/keeper-zathrian/3005-15638/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-15638\">Keeper Zathrian</a> when he bound the spirit of the <a href=\"/brecilian-forest/3035-2735/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2735\">Brecilian Forest</a> to a white wolf called <a href=\"/witherfang/3005-14349/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14349\">Witherfang</a>. The being comprised of Witherfang and \" <a href=\"/the-lady-of-the-forest/3005-14336/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14336\">The Lady of the Forest</a>\" then spread its own version of the werewolf disease. Zathrian himself lives as long as his curse remains, yet killing him does not end it, he must end it willingly. Convincing him to do so is a choice of <a href=\"/the-warden/3005-14352/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14352\">The Warden</a> during Dragon Age: Origins.</p><h3>Darkspawn</h3><p>The <a href=\"/darkspawn/3015-4263/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4263\">Darkspawn</a> are corrupted versions of each race, infected by the same taint which corrupted the Tevinter Imperium Magister Lords upon being thrown back down to Thedas by The Maker.</p><ul><li>Darkspawn humans are known as <a href=\"///\">Hurlocks</a></li><li>Dwarfs become <a href=\"///\">Genlocks</a></li><li>Elves become <a href=\"///\">Shrieks</a></li><li>Qunari become <a href=\"///\">Ogres</a></li><li>Dragons become Dragon thralls</li><li>Wolves and Werewolves become <a href=\"///\">Blight Wolves</a> and Blight Werewolves (who are still living creatures and can be infected, despite being possessed) respectively</li><li>Old Gods become archdemons.</li></ul><p>Females of each species are captured (with the exceptions of dragons, wolves, werewolves and Old Gods), violated and mutilated into <a href=\"///\">Broodmothers</a>. Broodmothers can give birth to thousands of its Darkspawn counterparts during their lifetimes.</p><p>Due to \"The Calling\" Darkspawn are driven to seek out the Old Gods from deep underground through the link between the Old Gods and the former Tevinter Magister Lords taint. Upon Darkspawn touching the Old Gods they become tainted and turn into archdemons, awakening them and starting a Blight. Normally they dwell underground in the remnants of the Dwarven kingdom searching for Old Gods.</p><h3>Spirits and Demons</h3><p>Spirits and Demons, who reside in The Fade, were the first species to be created by The Maker. Whereas Spirits and Demons could change the Fade to their liking yet lacked the ability to truly imagine and create something, the mortals of Thedas have this imagination to create but was not given the ability to shape Thedas as they wished.</p><p>The concept of a Demon in the Dragon Age franchise is not an evil species, but rather Spirits who are malicious. The traits that separate Spirits from Demons are that of <a href=\"/justice/3005-14314/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14314\">Justice</a>, Valor, Compassion and Fortitude and the traits that separate Demons from Spirits are Rage, Desire, Hunger and Pride.</p><p>Spirits look upon the mortal realm with curiosity and indifference but Demons are jealous towards that which the mortal races have that they themselves don't. This is why a Demon will try to bargain with mages in order to see the mortal world with their own eyes. The weakness of such mages is why Abominations are born.</p><h2>History, Philosophy and Religion</h2><h3>Tevinter Imperium, Darkspawn, Blights and Grey Wardens</h3><p>Through their alliance with the Old Gods, the Imperium learn of how to use magic. This became the basis of Tevinter society in which the Old Gods are worshiped and a strong emphasis is put on the use of magic. The Imperium Chantry is the center of this train of thought, in which a male mage is appointed \"The Divine,\" their religious leader in opposition to The Chantry's Divine, who is always female and due to The Chantry's views on magic, never a mage.</p><p>It is said to have been the Old Gods themselves who convinced the Imperium to overthrow The Maker. Upon stepping into the Golden City it immediately became the Black City, turned by the corruption of the Magister Lords. They were cast out, and returned to Thedas corrupted, the first Darkspawn, who started the Blight across Thedas.</p><p>The Darkspawn are drawn to the Old Gods who sleep deep underground, said to have been imprisoned there by The Maker. <a href=\"/the-architect/3005-13604/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-13604\">The Architect</a> once described it as a \"beautiful song\" and that the Old Gods are perfection that they will never know because as soon as they reach it, the Old God, they corrupt it with the taint. The corrupted Old God becomes an archdemon and leads the Darkspawn into battle as the Blight ravages the land.</p><p>The Grey Wardens were created to combat the Blights, only they fight to specifically to overcome it and only they can end it.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/47865/1081802-duncan.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1081802\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.6958762886598\" data-width=\"388\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 388px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:169.6%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/47865/1081802-duncan.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1081802\"><img alt=\"The Grey Warden-Commander of Ferelden, Duncan\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 377px) 100vw, 377px\" data-width=\"377\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/4/47865/1081802-duncan.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/4/47865/1081802-duncan.jpg 388w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/4/47865/1081802-duncan.jpg 377w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Grey Warden-Commander of Ferelden, Duncan\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/4/47865/1081802-duncan.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/4/47865/1081802-duncan.jpg 388w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/4/47865/1081802-duncan.jpg 377w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 377px) 100vw, 377px\" data-width=\"377\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Grey Warden-Commander of Ferelden, Duncan</figcaption></figure><p>Through The Joining, Grey Wardens drink <a href=\"/darkspawn-blood/3055-3955/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3955\">Darkspawn blood</a>, either becoming Grey Wardens or dying in the process. This gives them the ability to sense Darkspawn through the taint and the Darkspawn conversely to sense them. They Grey Wardens continuously sacrifice themselves for centuries in order to protect everyone else.</p><p><i>In war, victory. In peace, vigilance. In death, sacrifice.</i></p><p>No matter how many times the first archdemon, Dumat, was killed it would always return. With the creation of the Grey Wardens, the reason for this was discovered. If a normal human kills the archdemon, its soul simply flies to the body of the nearest Darkspawn, they themselves being soulless. But if a Grey Warden kills the archdemon the soul of the archdemon will inhabit the tainted body of the very same Grey Warden, killing them both.</p><p>Grey Wardens have two very important assets at their disposal. The first is the Rite of Conscription. This allows the Grey Wardens to draft anyone into the Grey Wardens and undertake The Joining. No-one is exempt, from Kings to mages to elves and dwarves. The second are ancient treaties signed by the elven, dwarven and mage peoples that decrees that they must fight alongside the Grey Wardens during a Blight.</p><h3>The Chantry, The Seekers of Truth, Templars and Mages</h3><p>As the opposition of the Tevinter Imperium and its attitudes towards magic, The Chantry focuses heavily on The Maker's second commandment, \"Magic must serve man, not rule over him.\" To this end The Chantry rules over all Circles of Magi, keeping Mages under lock and key where the Templars watch over them. This is in co-ordinance with aggressive Seekers of Truth, the order responsible for the Templars, who formed a pact with The Chantry.</p><p>The Chantry has the power to take any child who is seen to have magical capability from their families for training at the circle. From they mages are chosen to either undergo The Harrowing or to become a member of the Tranquil. The Harrowing is a test undertaken by mage apprentices to enter the Fade and attempt to resist Demons who would possess their bodies.</p><p>Success means they are officially considered mages and failure would result in them transforming into Abominations, who would be slain by the templars overseeing The Harrowing. Those who are deemed likely to fail have their link to The Fade and therefore their emotions cut-off making them a Tranquil. They no longer have access to mage abilities but they'll never be possessed as long as they live.</p><p>The Templars themselves are under a form of slavery by the Chantry and the Seekers. Templars take Lyrium under order of \"The Chantry\" to keep them under control, even when the Templars begin to suffer from addiction to Lyrium. The official take on it is that Lyrium improves the Templars' abilities.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Novels</h3><p>Three Dragon Age novels exist, all written by Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age II Senior Writer, David Gaider. The Stolen Throne and The Calling are prequel novels released in March and October of 2009 respectively.

Combat plays like a traditional third-person action game; War can lock on and attack enemies, dealing damage and raising the combo. Outside of combat, War explores dungeons and the overworld, utilizing a variety of items such as the Voidwalker (a device which can create two interchangeable portals) to traverse these areas, fight bosses, and collect more items.</p><p>The first game in the franchise, Darksiders was very well received from both a critical and a commercial standpoint. The game scored an aggregate ranking of 84% from Game Rankings and an 83% score from Metacritic. Commercially, the game performed well, selling approximately one million units worldwide. The game was well-received for its innovative gameplay, fast-paced combat, interesting puzzles, voice-acting, and high replay value (along with many comparisons to the <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda/3025-9/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-9\">Legend of Zelda</a> franchise).</p><h3>Darksiders II</h3><p><a href=\"/darksiders-ii/3030-29941/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-29941\">The sequel to Darksiders</a> was announced in late May 2011 and further details were revealed at E3 2011.

The brand new engine, which was rewritten from the ground up, has introduced a vast number of improvements to both the visual representation and the simulation fidelity of the game. <br/>\u00a0<br/></p><h2>Game System<br/></h2> <p> Starting with the very first title in the series Battlefront has made a bold decision to do away with such wargame concepts as movement squares and hexes, action points, top-down 2D view, alternating player turns, and abstract fire and damage models. Instead Combat Mission games are rendered in a fully 3-dimensional battle space with each unit\u2019s movement and each individual shot being calculated in real-time with an inch-by-inch precision, while still allowing players take the time to examine the battlefield, plan their strategy, and give out the orders. <br/>\u00a0<br/>Each \u201cturn\u201d in Combat Mission is comprised on two alternating phases \u2013 an order phase and an execution phase. During the order phase the action is paused, much like in a classic turn-based wargame, effectively giving players an indefinite amount of time to issue the orders. Once the orders are submitted the game advances into the execution phase where the orders are resolved in real-time for both side simultaneously with movement and fire outcomes taking immediate effect. The execution phase lasts for 60 seconds during which players are not able to alter any of the orders given to the units, however have a full control of the camera and are able to pause and rewind the action in order to observe different parts of the battlefield. Once the player is done watching the 60 second segment the game advances to the next \u201cturn\u201d and the process is repeated. <br/>\u00a0<br/>CMx2 has also introduced a pause-anytime real-time mode, which in effect allows the player to control the length of the \u201cexecution phase.\u201d<br/>\u00a0<br/></p><h2>Scale &amp; Scope</h2> <p>The smallest unit in the game which the player can directly control are squads or teams of infantry, and individual vehicles. Scenarios allow for a force as small as a depleted platoon, or as large as a several reinforced battalions. The condition and status of each man, vehicle and weapon is kept track of for maximum realism. <br/>\u00a0<br/>Map size can vary in size from only a few hundred square meters to several kilometers, and can vary in type from an open desert to a dense forest impenetrable to vehicles to a highly built up urban area, and anything in between.\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>A typical scenario lasts about 20-60 turns, or 20-60 minutes of simulated combat. <br/>\u00a0<br/></p><h2>Historical Accuracy</h2> <p>Full Tables of Organization and Equipment (TO&amp;E) for all the nations represented are modeled with thousands of different units, weapons, and vehicles available depending on the year, month and region. Vehicle and uniform models are meticulously researched and recreated in the game. Details include everything from period-accurate paint schemes to historically correct ammunition load-outs and all the way to such technical details as track ground pressure and gun muzzle velocity. <br/><br/></p><h2>User Content</h2> <p>Thus far Combat Mission has been very welcoming to user-created content, and as a result the series has a very talented and eager community. Both generations of the game engine include a full-featured map and scenario editors, allowing users to create their own terrain, preselect units, and establishing objectives for the scenario. Hundreds, if not thousands, of user-made scenarios exist, many of which are made with a great deal of historical accuracy.<br/>\u00a0<br/>While the technical aspects of the game engine are hard-coded in order to preserve the integrity of the game, anything cosmetic can be modified \u2013 a feature which the community has taken a great advantage of to create custom content ranging from slight uniform modifications to a complete conversion to a different theater. </p>", "guid": "3025-1656", "name": "Combat Mission"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-1657", "name": "Birdie King"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-1658", "name": "Adventure"}, {"description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The name of this franchise simply comes from the fact that the games involved use characters from both <a href=\"/capcom/3010-367/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-367\">Capcom </a>and <a href=\"/snk-playmore/3010-616/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-616\">SNK </a>franchises. Each company gives their take on the others characters by pitting them against one another in various styles of games, generally the fighting genre.</p><h2>History</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The creation of this franchise is the result of a misunderstanding of the masses when Arcadia Magazine did a cover story on The King of Fighters \u00b498 and Street Fighter Alpha 3 in the same issue, which where both released in the second quarter of 1998. The idea was to compare the two games against one another, but people misunderstood the phrase <i>'KOF vs. SF</i>' for a game that included both franchises.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Because there was such a positive outcry from fans, Capcom and SNK decided to work mutually on a series of games using the concept.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Conflicting interviews from both companies add confusion to the possibility of further games under the versus banner, in interviews both have stated that they would not do any further collaboration with one another. However in an interview during January of 2009, Yoshinori Ono, the producer of Street Fighter IV, expressed interest in doing another game in the series if fan demand was high enough.</p><h2>SNK's Collapse</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In 2000, SNK was about to file for bankruptcy when it was acquired by <a href=\"/aruze-corp/3010-2666/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2666\">Aruze</a> creator of popular pachinko machines. Aruze also acquired the SNK vs Capcom license, and used to it to create two games for the Neo Geo Pocket, <a href=\"/snk-vs-capcom-match-of-the-millennium/3030-12312/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12312\">SNK vs. Capcom: The Match of the Millennium</a> and <a href=\"/snk-vs-capcom-card-fighters-clash-snk-capcom-version/3030-5134/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5134\">SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash</a> and which all turned out to be commercial disasters selling a combined total of only fifty thousand units total.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">A contributing factor to the demise of SNK was the two Capcom produced Vs.games that turned out to be financial successes. Because the games were produced by Capcom, most of the profit from the two games went to Capcom rather than SNK.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">SNK filed for bankruptcy on October 22nd 2001, putting their intellectual properties up for bid. Most of the employees then left the company to create the hardware and software company <a href=\"/brezzasoft/3010-4577/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-4577\">Brezzasoft</a>.</p><h2>SNK's Rebirth</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In 2001 Eikichi Kawasaki, the original founder of SNK who had left the company under Aruze's command and founded Playmore, bid on the intellectual property rights and won. Kawasaki began rehiring past SNK employees and eventually purchased Brezzasoft which was then renamed to SNK Neo Geo Corp. The SNK of today resembles the company of old in many ways, and through tight partnerships with companies in many countries keeps their brand coming to their fans across the globe.</p><h2>Capcom Produced Games</h2><h3><a href=\"/capcom-vs-snk-millennium-fight-2000/3030-8768/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8768\"><b>Capcom vs. SNK: Millennium Fight 2000</b></a></h3><figure style=\"width: 597px\" data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1614/819292-cvs_dc_us.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-819292\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.0050251256281\" data-width=\"597\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1614/819292-cvs_dc_us.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-819292\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/1614/819292-cvs_dc_us.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/1614/819292-cvs_dc_us.jpg 597w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/1614/819292-cvs_dc_us.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 636px) 100vw, 636px\" data-width=\"636\"></a></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Released in 2000 for the Sega NAOMI arcade hardware and ported to the <a href=\"/dreamcast/3045-37/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-37\">Dreamcast</a> later that year.
