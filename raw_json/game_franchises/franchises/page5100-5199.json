While selling copies of Bakehouse at ComiCup 4 on 28 May 2009, Yuzhong (MICA Team's director) wrote that he chatted with someone at the convention who inspired him to make a strategy game. One year later, Yuzhong wrote that he underestimated the amount of work that would go into making one of those, but continued anyway until he made the following game...</p><h3><a href=\"/codename-bakery-girl/3030-84666/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-84666\">Codename: Bakery Girl</a></h3><p>A strategy RPG made by Team MICA in 2013. Originally conceived as a sequel to Girl of the Bakehouse, the game instead changed radically, becoming more of a top-down strategy RPG with multiple endings and playable characters, even though it shares some story structure. Though created three years before Girls' Frontline, the story takes place about 30 years after its events, in the Second Cold War.</p><p>After the success of Girls' Frontline, a remake of the game is scheduled for worldwide release in 2023, entitled <a href=\"/reverse-collapse-code-name-bakery/3030-74835/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-74835\">Reverse Collapse: Code Name Bakery</a>. MICA promised the game would have updated graphics and gameplay mechanics, and become more explicitly tied into the larger Girls' Frontline universe.</p><h3><a href=\"/girls-frontline/3030-54819/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-54819\">Girls' Frontline</a></h3><p>A tactical RPG with gacha elements where the player is an unseen rookie Commander leading a squad of robotic girls soldiers known as \"T-Dolls\" to contain a threat that arose in the wake of World War 3. The game was made available in Mainland China on May 20, 2016, in Taiwan and Hong Kong on January 18, 2017, in South Korea on June 30, 2017, in English worldwide on May 8, 2018, and in Japan on July 1st, 2018.</p><h3>Girls' Frontline 2: Exilium</h3><p>A sequel to the original Girls Frontline, set about 12 years after the start of the game. The government has disbanded Griffin &amp; Kruyger, fearing the PMC to be too powerful, but the Commander continues to fight with their T-Dolls in order to rescue a captured girl and get to the heart of a conspiracy involving relics. As of January 2023, it is still in development, though there have been closed beta tests run on June 29, 2021 and October 18, 2021.</p><h2>Spinoff Games</h2><h3><a href=\"/neural-cloud/3030-88014/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-88014\">Project Neural Cloud</a></h3><p>A \"roguelike\" strategy game where the player must lead a special group of Dolls called the \"Exiled\" through a digital world called Magrasea against the Sanctifiers who seek to cleanse them, and the Entropics who seek to corrupt all data. This game has more 3D character models and more fast-paced action. The game was first released in mainland China on September 23, 2021, and a Global English version followed over a year later in November 21, 2022, with Taiwan and Korea getting their own release two days later on November 23, followed by a Japanese release on the 24th.</p><h3>Girls' Frontline: Glitch Land</h3><p>Technically a fan-made game, but officially authorized by MICA. The game appears to be pixel based and stars HK416 as a main character. The main developer of this project left the team in early 2022 and Glitch Land is currently on indefinite hiatus.</p><h2>Anime</h2><p>Two series of comedic shorts, 12 episodes each, were released in 2019: <em>Girls' Frontline: Healing Chapter</em> and <em>Girls' Frontline: Madness Chapter</em>. Both were originally dubbed in Mandarin Chinese, with a Japanese dub following later.</p><p>An official <em>Girls' Frontline</em> anime premiered on January 8, 2022, produced by Warner Bros. Japan and animated by Asahi Production, following the main plot of the game.</p><h2>Manga</h2><p>An official manga series following the main plot titled <em>Girls' Frontline: The Song of Dolls</em>, illustrated by Miharu, is published in both Chinese and Japanese.
