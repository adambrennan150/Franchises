Physical X-men, like <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/wolverine/3005-10/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-10\">Wolverine</a>, are especially effective at ground combat and are used in a similar fashion as traditional \"<a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/tank/3015-438/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-438\">tanks</a>\" in other RPGs.

The small country of Gallia finds itself under attack by the great Autocratic East Europan Imperial Alliance (the \"Empire\") to its east, who seek to attack a confederation of states known as the Atlantic Federation to its west and also to secure its stores of \"Ragnite\" which powers most of the machinery in the world. However, the country of Gallia calls up its militia and armed forces to stage a counterattack, eventually drawing enough blood to force the Empire back behind its borders. A majority of the Valkyria Chronicles series is either set during this conflict in Gallia or during other theaters in EW2, the only exceptions being Valkyria Chronicles II (which is set after the war( and Valkyria Revolution (which takes place in an alternate universe).</p><h2>Plot</h2><h3>Valkyria Chronicles</h3><p>The peaceful town of Bruhl in the country of Gallia finds itself under attack by a massive armed Imperial force, as <a href=\"/alicia-melchiott/3005-8984/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-8984\">Alicia Melchott</a> of the local town watch tracks down a strange man who seems to be recording the nearby wildlife. The young man, <a href=\"/welkin-gunther/3005-8985/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-8985\">Welkin Gunther</a>, helps Alicia repel the invaders from the town. Being the son of a legendary general, Welkin then ends up leading Squad 7 with his custom-made tank, the Edelweiss, and proves instrumental in helping Gallia repel the invading Imperial force from its borders.</p><h3>Valkyria Chronicles 2</h3><p>With the end of EW2, Gallia only has a short-lived peace. The new leader of Gallia, <a href=\"/cordelia-gi-randgriz/3005-14931/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14931\">Archduchess Cordelia Gi Randgriz</a>, has revealed her Darcsen lineage. This new information sparked a rebellion within the country, as the angered citizens and nobles formed the Gallian Revolutionary Army, led by the aristocratic House Gassenarl, with the goal of purging the Darcsens from the country and taking Cordelia off her throne. As the regular army cannot mobilize against an internal threat, the task ends up falling to <a href=\"/avan-hardins/3005-12735/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-12735\">Avan Hardins</a> and Class G from Gallia's Lanseal Academy.</p><h3>Valkyria Chronicles 3: Unrecorded Chronicles</h3><p>During EW2, the history books never mentioned a pivotal force that helped Gallia beat the Empire: The 422nd Nameless, a suicide squad full of traitors, troublemakers, and other criminals who are stripped of their name and rank and are given missions that are near-impossible for the regular army to do, lest they be thrown in front of a firing squad for refusing. Lanseal graduate Kurt Irving, framed for a crime he didn't commit, is forced to take on the role of Captain for the Nameless as \"Number 7\" while he tries to help his squad survive long enough to clear their names.</p><h3>Valkyria Chronicles 4</h3><p>At the beginning of EW2, the Atlantic Federation lost 30% of its territory to the Empire's blitzkrieg tactics. Trying to put a quick end to the war, the Federate's \"Edinburgh Army,\" composed largely of volunteers from around Europa, launches Operation Northern Cross. The Operation would use smaller, faster military units to head north and invade the capital of the Empire to put a quicker end to the fighting before the Empire could dominate the continent. Squad E, led by <a href=\"/claude-wallace/3005-36166/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-36166\">Claude Wallace</a>, would prove instrumental in this Operation.</p><h3>Valkyria Revolution</h3><p>A spinoff completely unconnected to the mainline Chronicles universe, though it shares some similar concepts. Revolution tells the story of the \"Five Traitors\" who secretly pushed the tiny nation of Jutland to war against the massive Ruz Empire. The Traitors hoped to both end Ruz's stranglehold over Jutland and to kill the Ruzi Emperor for kidnapping their foster mother several years ago. The story is told <a href=\"/in-medias-res/3015-1279/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1279\"><em>in medias res</em></a> as a discussion between a Jutish grad-student and his teacher, Richelle, who reveals to the student the secret history of the war not written in his text books.</p><p> </p><h2>Common Gameplay Concepts</h2><p>The mainline Valkyria Chronicles titles all share similar gameplay mechanics, in that the player must command a small squad of allied troops to victory, with the condition usually being to capture the enemy base in the fewest turns possible for the highest ranking. Sometimes, the objective might be different, such as holding out a position for a set number of turns, or killing all enemies in the level.</p><p>The player's side begins with a set amount of Command Points (CP) that are spent to move and attack individual units. The selected unit has a set amount of Action Points (AP) that they can use to move around the battlefield, capture enemy bases, and take one of the following actions (actions may not apply to all unit classes):</p><ul><li>Attack with primary weapon</li><li>Attack with secondary weapon</li><li>Attack with grenade</li><li>Heal self or nearby ally</li></ul><p>A single unit can be used multiple times in the same turn, provided the player can spend additional CP on them, but their max AP will decrease, limiting the amount of ground they can cover in a single turn. If a commander is alive on the battlefield, the player can also issue a special order that will allow them to buff or heal units at the cost of some CP.</p><p>While moving around the map, enemy units or vehicles may perform Interception Fire if the unit enters their line of sight and weapon's firing range. Enemies attacking the controlled character in this manner have infinite ammo, but may be forced to reload depending on their weapon and rate of fire. When the unit switches from movement to combat mode, the enemy will stop firing until the unit's action is complete. An enemy unit might also counterattack if they have any HP left after the chosen unit's attack, depending on their unit type and firing range.</p><p>If a character loses all HP, they are downed on the battlefield. Allied units can usually be saved if another allied unit touches them on the battlefield before a set number of turns have passed, being forcibly \"retreated\" to base. However, if an enemy touches a downed ally, or they are not rescued in time, they are fatally wounded and unable to be used for the rest of the game. If the ally is important to the story, this may result in a Game Over situation.</p><p>The turn ends when all CP have been exhausted, or when the player manually selects \"End Phase,\" in which the enemy AI will perform their actions.</p><h3>Characters</h3><p>The player will balance their squad's strengths and weaknesses, both in terms of the unit's job and each individual unit's quirks (Battle Potentials) that can be useful or harmful, depending on the situation.</p><p>Players are encouraged to try experimenting with the various units, sometimes even unlocking special side-stories where the character reveals more about their personal backstory. By completing this sidestory, the character can even have their negative Potential replaced with a positive one, or upgrade an already-positive Potential. Some characters' Potentials may only change as the main story progresses.</p><h3>Headquarters</h3><p>Every game has a Headquarters where the player can upgrade multiple units at once by spending accumulated experience points (EXP) on a class, \"training\" every unit of that class at once. At certain points, increasing the level of a class can unlock new positive Potentials for every member of that class, new Orders for the commander, or upgrade the class itself and allow everyone in the class to use improved equipment.</p>", "guid": "3025-1405", "name": "Valkyria Chronicles"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-1406", "name": "Anime Freak FX"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-1407", "name": "EA Sports Cricket"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-1408", "name": "The Hardy Boys"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-1409", "name": "NASCAR (EA Sports)"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-1410", "name": "NASCAR Racing"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-1411", "name": "NASCAR Heat"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-1412", "name": "Trivial Pursuit"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-1413", "name": "Austin Powers"}, {"description": "<br/>", "guid": "3025-1414", "name": "James Cameron's Avatar"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-1415", "name": "Maya the Bee"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-1416", "name": "Brandish"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-1417", "name": "Military Madness"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-1420", "name": "Puzzle Iroiro Gekkan Crossword House"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-1421", "name": "Kidz Sports"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-1422", "name": "The Darkness"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-1423", "name": "Crimson Sea"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-1424", "name": "Momotaro Dentetsu"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-1425", "name": "World Series Baseball"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-1426", "name": "Arcus"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-1427", "name": "Blake Stone"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-1428", "name": "MASK"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-1429", "name": "Tear Ring Saga"}, {"description": "<h2>Overview</h2>The <i>Gundam VS</i> series, as the name implies, is based on the massive <a data-ref-id=\"3025-290\" href=\"/gundam/3025-290/\" slug=\"gundam\">           Mobile Suit Gundam</a> anime franchise. The <i>VS</i> series offers arena-style, 2-on-2 battles between \"mobile suits\"; its roots can be traced back to <a data-ref-id=\"3025-695\" href=\"/virtual-on/3025-695/\" slug=\"virtual-on\">           Virtual-On</a>, the grandfather of all 3D mecha combat games. Every game in the franchise debuted in the arcades, but nearly all of them have received console releases. <br/>\u00a0<br/>The Gundam VS games have proven to be popular in Japanese arcades, with the later games fairly consistently ranking at #2, behind <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20689\" href=\"/tekken-6/3030-20689/\" slug=\"tekken-6\">   Tekken 6</a> or <a data-ref-id=\"3030-23833\" href=\"/tekken-6-bloodline-rebellion/3030-23833/\" slug=\"tekken-6-bloodline-rebellion\">  Tekken 6 Bloodline Rebellion</a>, in <i>Arcadia Magazine's</i> monthly Top 10 listings. <br/><br/><h2>System</h2>Each Gundam VS game uses four-buttons: one button for the \"Beam Rifle\" or other projectile weaponry, one button for the \"Beam Saber\" or other melee attacks, one button for jumping, and one button for toggling targets. Additional attacks are carried out by combining the Range, Melee, and Jump buttons, or by \"charging\" a weapon. Mobile Suits can \"step\" (a short, quick dash) by tapping the joystick/D-Pad in a single direction twice; They can also fly in the air for a short time by holding the Jump button, and dash in the air by holding Jump and double-tapping the joystick/D-Pad (early games) or pressing Jump twice. Some games allow the player to defend with a joystick command, while others have automated blocking.<br/><br/>In most games, there is a team power-up that can be activated once a special meter fills. It is usually triggered when both players press the Start button in the arcades, or when the \"Command\" button is pressed in the console versions.<br/><br/>Both teams have a Battle Gauge representing their current battle strength. Each time a player's mobile suit is destroyed, the gauge is lowered by that suit's \"cost\"; The object of the game is to lower your opponent's gauge to zero. Mobile Suits are organized by their overall cost, but the scoring system varies with each \"era\" of the series (The Universal Century games use 600 as a representation of a full bar, the SEED games use 1000, and the crossover games use 6000). In the crossover games, if an MS costs more than the amount of Battle Gauge remaining, its HP will be reduced accordingly (if a 3000 cost suit respawns with 1000 points remaining, it will have 1/3 of its maximum HP).<br/><br/>If a Time Over is reached, both teams are disqualified.<br/><br/><h2>Franchise History</h2><a data-ref-id=\"3030-22717\" href=\"/mobile-suit-gundam-federation-vs-zeon/3030-22717/\" slug=\"mobile-suit-gundam-federation-vs-zeon\">           Mobile Suit Gundam: Federation vs. Zeon</a><br/><br/>The first game of the series. This game's mobile suits are mostly based on the original <i>Mobile Suit Gundam</i> series, although a handful of MS from alternate series based on the \"One Year War\" are included. It would be released for the Playstation 2 as \"Federation vs. Zeon DX,\" with added content. It is one of only two games in the franchise to see an international release.<br/><br/><a data-ref-id=\"3030-26731\" href=\"/mobile-suit-zeta-gundam-aeug-vs-titans/3030-26731/\" slug=\"mobile-suit-zeta-gundam-aeug-vs-titans\">           Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam: AEUG vs. Titans</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-22604\" href=\"/mobile-suit-gundam-gundam-vs-zeta-gundam/3030-22604/\" slug=\"mobile-suit-gundam-gundam-vs-zeta-gundam\">          Mobile Suit Gundam: Gundam vs. Zeta Gundam</a><br/><br/>AEUG vs. Titans is the second game of the series. This game's mobile suits are based on <i>Mobile Suit Gundam's</i> first sequel, <i>Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam</i>; some suits from Federation vs. Zeon are also available. This game introduces the Hyper Combination system, which powers up both members of a team after a special gauge is filled. This game would also be ported to the Playstation 2. The Playstation 2 version of the game, which added more mobile suits, would be ported back to the arcades as \"AEUG vs. Titans DX\"; this version of the game would then be ported to the Playstation 2 (again) and Gamecube as \"Gundam vs. Zeta Gundam.\"  <br/><br/>Gundam vs. Zeta Gundam adds three units from <i>Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ</i>; since the PS2 version of the game was released worldwide, this game is the West's first exposure to <i>Gundam ZZ</i>. GvsZ expands the Hyper Combination system into the Awaken System: The player can choose whether their Awaken boosts attack power (similar to Hyper Combination), speed, or allows a destroyed unit to be revived at no cost.<br/><br/><a data-ref-id=\"3030-26732\" href=\"/mobile-suit-gundam-seed-rengou-vs-zaft/3030-26732/\" slug=\"mobile-suit-gundam-seed-rengou-vs-zaft\">           Mobile Suit Gundam SEED: Rengou vs. Z.A.F.T.</a><br/><br/>Instead of following the Universal Century timeline and making a <i>Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ: AEUG vs. Neo Zeon</i> game, the series turns towards its (then) newest and hottest property: <i>Mobile Suit Gundam SEED</i>. <i>Rengou vs. ZAFT</i> (also known as <i>Alliance vs. ZAFT</i> or <i>OMNI vs. ZAFT</i>) introduces an entirely different set of MS and refines the gameplay of the previous titles. SEED Mode is included, which works similarly to Hyper Combination. The game was released on the Playstation 2 and the PSP (interestingly enough, the latter \"Rengou vs. ZAFT Portable\" was ported after the release of Rengou vs. ZAFT II, and includes some suits from its sucessor).<br/><br/><a data-ref-id=\"3030-26733\" href=\"/mobile-suit-gundam-seed-destiny-rengou-vs-zaft-ii/3030-26733/\" slug=\"mobile-suit-gundam-seed-destiny-rengou-vs-zaft-ii\">           Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny: Rengou vs. Z.A.F.T. II</a><br/><br/>The sequel to Rengou vs. Z.A.F.T. This game features more mobile suits than any other game in the franchise. The Awaken system returns from Gundam vs. Zeta Gundam, offering Rush (essentially SEED mode from the previous game), Power, and Speed (faster footspeed). This game was ported to the PS2 as \"Rengou vs. Z.A.F.T. II Plus.\"<br/><br/><a data-ref-id=\"3030-23032\" href=\"/mobile-suit-gundam-gundam-vs-gundam/3030-23032/\" slug=\"mobile-suit-gundam-gundam-vs-gundam\">           Mobile Suit Gundam: Gundam vs. Gundam</a><br/><br/>Instead of focusing on a single series, Gundam vs. Gundam throws MS from every major animated Gundam series together. This game includes Mobile Assists, which are essentially the 3D equivalent of <a data-ref-id=\"3025-513\" href=\"/marvel-vs-capcom/3025-513/\" slug=\"marvel-vs-capcom\">           Marvel vs. Capcom's</a> assists or the Strikers of some <a data-ref-id=\"3025-407\" href=\"/king-of-fighters/3025-407/\" slug=\"king-of-fighters\">           King of Fighters</a> games. The Hyper Combination/Awaken systems are replaced with G-Crossover, which allows a team to utilize weapons of mass destruction based on their respective series in unison, including colony dropping, the GENESIS laser, and the Gundam Meisters. The game would be ported exclusively for the PSP.<br/><br/><a data-ref-id=\"3030-23686\" href=\"/mobile-suit-gundam-gundam-vs-gundam-next/3030-23686/\" slug=\"mobile-suit-gundam-gundam-vs-gundam-next\">           Mobile Suit Gundam: Gundam vs. Gundam NEXT</a><br/><br/>This game adds more mobile suits, does away with G-Crossover, and introduces \"NEXT Dashing,\" which allows the player to quickly evade attacks at the cost of some of their boost gauge. The Unicorn Gundam from <i>Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn</i> is included, marking its first appearance in a videogame. The game received an enhanced PSP port, as \"Mobile Suit Gundam: Gundam vs. Gundam Next Plus.\" <br/>\u00a0<br/><a data-ref-id=\"3030-30063\" href=\"/mobile-suit-gundam-extreme-vs/3030-30063/\" slug=\"mobile-suit-gundam-extreme-vs\">      Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme VS. </a><br/>\u00a0<br/>Extreme Vs. is the current Gundam Vs. game; it is also the first game in the series to be rendered in HD.
