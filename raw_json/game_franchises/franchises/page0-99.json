Since then he has been one of the most recognizable figures in video games to this day. He has inspired games, movies, cartoon shows and is still going strong. He has even branched out from his platform gaming origins into several new franchises, such as <em><a href=\"../../mario-tennis/62-512/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Mario Tennis</a></em>, <em><a href=\"../../mario-party/62-508/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Mario Party</a></em>, <em><a href=\"../../mario-rpg/62-510/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Mario RPG</a></em>, <em><a href=\"../../mario-kart/62-507/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Mario Kart</a></em> and more.</p><h2>Games</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/25/11444-Donkey Kong_640.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-11444\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/25/11444-Donkey Kong_640.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-11444\"><img alt=\"Mario's first appearance.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png w\" sizes=\"(max-width: px) 100vw, px\"></a><figcaption>Mario's first appearance.</figcaption></figure><p>Mario was first featured in the 1981 arcade title <em><a href=\"../../donkey-kong/61-311/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Donkey Kong</a></em>. The concept of the game was that Mario (then named Jumpman) had to save his girlfriend from his pet gorilla; <a href=\"../../donkey-kong/94-299/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Donkey Kong</a>. The player would walk up slanted floors, climb ladders and avoid barrels on his way to the to save his girlfriend.</p><p>In 1983, Nintendo developed and published Mario's second game, an arcade game titled simply <em>Mario Bros.</em> The game was primarily a competitive two-player focused title, featuring Mario and his brother <a href=\"/luigi/3005-370/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-370\">Luigi</a>. The object of the game was to kill more enemies (and collect their coins) than their counterpart while doing everything possible to inconvenience or kill the other player. This was accomplished by stomping on the heads of some enemies, using the <a href=\"/pow-block/3055-421/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-421\">POW Block</a> to knock some over so they could be kicked or jumping into the floor underneath enemies to knock them upside down. The game was notably included as a mini-game in the <a href=\"/game-boy-advance/3045-4/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-4\">GBA</a> <em>Super Mario Advance</em> releases.</p><p>Following Mario's arcade success came <em><a href=\"///\">Super Mario Bros.</a></em> for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1985. This was one of the first side-scrolling platforming games and featured Mario and his brother <a href=\"../../luigi/94-370/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Luigi</a> trying to save Princess Peach from <a href=\"../../bowser/94-337/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Bowser</a>. After three levels the player was faced with a castle with Bowser waiting at the end, after the player defeated him he was told that the princess is in another castle, starting a new set of levels.</p><p><em><a href=\"../../super-mario-bros-2/61-7406/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Super Mario Bros. 2</a></em> was released for the NES in 1988. This game was actually a modified version of Doki Doki Panic, an unrelated Japanese platformer that was converted into a Mario game. In this game, the player was given a choice to play as Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, and Toad. Each had their own unique way of handling; Luigi had the highest jumps, Peach could glide for several seconds, Toad had the most powerful jump but the least height and distance and Mario was the middle ground. In this game, Mario and his friends had to stop a frog named Wart from taking over Dream Land.</p><p><em><a href=\"../../super-mario-bros-3/61-10299/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Super Mario Bros. 3</a></em> was released in the United States in 1990, after being featured in the film <em>The Wizard</em>. The game was a return to the \"run and jump\" mechanics of the first Super Mario Brothers, and required Mario or Luigi to save the Princess and the rulers of 7 kingdoms by obtaining the wands that the Koopa kids had stolen. This game introduced the world map to Mario games, as well as new items like the raccoon tail and the Tanooki suit.</p><p>In his first Game Boy game, <em><a href=\"../../super-mario-land/61-19834/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Super Mario Land</a></em>, Mario had to save <a href=\"../../princess-daisy/94-807/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Princess Daisy</a> of Sarasaland from <a href=\"../../tatanga/94-2777/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Tatanga</a>, an alien that had captured her. The gameplay for this game was very similar to the previous installments, but the fire flower was changed to fire superballs, which bounced off walls, ceilings, and floors. They could be used to obtain hard to reach items.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/25/11448-snes_super_mario_world_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-11448\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/25/11448-snes_super_mario_world_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-11448\"><img alt=\"Super Mario World\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/25/11448-snes_super_mario_world_1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/25/11448-snes_super_mario_world_1.jpg 640w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/25/11448-snes_super_mario_world_1.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/25/11448-snes_super_mario_world_1.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Super Mario World</figcaption></figure><p>Super Mario Land had a sequel named, <em><a href=\"../../super-mario-land-2-6-golden-coins/61-14425/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins</a></em>. This game was the first appearance of <a href=\"../../wario/94-24/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Wario</a>, Mario's evil counterpart, who had taken over Mario's castle in his absence, during the events of the first <em>Mario Land</em>. He put all the inhabitants into a hypnotic state, making them believe Wario was their master. To enter his castle Mario had to find six golden coins scattered through the world, defeat Wario and free his people from Wario's spell.</p><p>Wario later starred in his own game, <em><a href=\"../../wario-land-super-mario-land-3/61-19225/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3</a></em>, the first in the Wario series of games.</p><p><em><a href=\"../../super-mario-world/61-1334/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Super Mario World</a></em> was a launch title, and pack-in, for the Super Nintendo, featuring Mario and Luigi fighting Bowser and his kids in various worlds. Accompanying them was <a href=\"../../yoshi/94-700/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Yoshi</a>, a dinosaur that Mario and Luigi could ride. Yoshi could eat enemies and, after eating shells, would gain a new ability. Blue shells allowed him to fly, red shells made him spit fire, and yellow made him land with a damaging puff of smoke.</p><p>In <em><a href=\"../../super-mario-world-2-yoshis-island/61-2866/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island</a></em>, Mario took a back seat and let Yoshi take the helm as the game told the beginnings of Mario and Luigi. Kamek, Bowser's sorcerer, foresaw that Mario and Luigi would cause trouble for Bowser in the future, so he tried to kidnap them as the Stork delivered them, but only managed to grab Luigi. Mario fell toward Yoshi's Island where a group of Yoshi's rescued him and set out to save Luigi, returning them both home. The gameplay in <em>Yoshi's Island</em> kept the platforming aspects of Mario games intact but added a feature that when Yoshi is hit, baby Mario would fly off his back to be reobtained before Kamek could take him. Yoshi was also able to fire eggs at his enemies.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/70944/1229654-super_mario_64_title_screen.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1229654\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/70944/1229654-super_mario_64_title_screen.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1229654\"><img alt=\"The title screen for Super Mario 64.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/7/70944/1229654-super_mario_64_title_screen.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/7/70944/1229654-super_mario_64_title_screen.jpg 600w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/7/70944/1229654-super_mario_64_title_screen.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The title screen for Super Mario 64.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/7/70944/1229654-super_mario_64_title_screen.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/7/70944/1229654-super_mario_64_title_screen.jpg 600w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/7/70944/1229654-super_mario_64_title_screen.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The title screen for Super Mario 64.</figcaption></figure><p>Mario's first 3D appearance was in <em><a href=\"../../super-mario-64/61-2931/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Super Mario 64</a></em>.

It was billed as a family comedy. The movie starred Mario (Bob Hoskins) and Luigi (John Leguizamo) in a fight against King Koopa (Dennis Hooper). Instead of Princess Peach, this movie had Princess Daisy (Samantha Mathis). The movie took place in Brooklyn, in a dystopian future. The film involves two dimensions (one of which is ruled by an evolved humanlike race of dinosaurs). King Koopa is trying to merge the two dimensions, while Mario and Luigi fight to stop him. In addition, the film has a romance between Luigi and Princess Daisy. The film was considered to be a major flop (and a terrible movie), with it making only about $21 million, while the budget was around $42 million. Later, a soundtrack of the film was released.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/950013-supermariobrossupershow.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-950013\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.336\" data-width=\"375\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 375px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:133.6%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/950013-supermariobrossupershow.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-950013\"><img alt=\"The Super Mario Bros.

The first such show, <em>Saturday Supercade</em>, began airing in 1983 on CBS. It was produced by Ruby-Spears Productions, and aired on Saturday mornings. The show ran for two seasons, with each episode focusing on characters from popular arcade video games of the time. Starring characters included Donkey Kong, Mario, and Pauline (all from the <em>Donkey Kong</em> arcade game).</p><p><em>The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!</em> was the first show based primarily on the <em>Mario</em> video games (rather than the industry as a whole). It aired from September 4, 1989 to December 1, 1989. The show was produced by DiC Entertainment, and was broadcasted by Viacom Enterprises (although Nintendo has since given the rights to DiC). Episodes were structured as partially live action and partially animated. Every episode began an ended with a live-action segment starring Mario (Captain Lou Albano) and Luigi (Danny Wells) living in Brooklyn, New York. Halfway in the episode, an animated segment would play. These would usually last about ten minutes long, based on the games <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> and <em>Super Mario Bros. 2</em>. The show also had <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> television show every Friday.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/950014-6a00d83452033569e200e54f5cdaee8833_800wi.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-950014\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.77604166666667\" data-width=\"384\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 384px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:77.6%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/950014-6a00d83452033569e200e54f5cdaee8833_800wi.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-950014\"><img alt=\"The live action King Koopa.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/950014-6a00d83452033569e200e54f5cdaee8833_800wi.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/950014-6a00d83452033569e200e54f5cdaee8833_800wi.png 384w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/950014-6a00d83452033569e200e54f5cdaee8833_800wi.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The live action King Koopa.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/950014-6a00d83452033569e200e54f5cdaee8833_800wi.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/950014-6a00d83452033569e200e54f5cdaee8833_800wi.png 384w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/950014-6a00d83452033569e200e54f5cdaee8833_800wi.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The live action King Koopa.</figcaption></figure><p><em>King Koopa's Kool Kartoons</em> was a children's show that broadcasted in Southern California during 1989 and 1990.

The game dispenses with Master Chief as the main character and instead focuses on a brand new character; a silent <a href=\"/odst/3015-641/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-641\">ODST</a> soldier known as \"The Rookie\" . After an incident which causes The Rookie to be separated from the rest of his squad, he awakes 6 hours after dropping into the city, alone. A large part of the game is spent exploring the city, trying to piece together the fate of his squad. While no longer in control of a spartan, the gameplay is still very similar to that of previous Halo games. The player is able to use all of the previous weapons with the only change of no longer being able to dual wield. Also while the traditional shield mechanic is now replaced by a stamina system, the two function in a similar manner. Despite the name, the events in the game actually occur during the time of Halo 2.</p><h3>Halo: Spartan Assault</h3><p><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/halo-spartan-assault/3030-42843/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-42843\">Halo: Spartan Assault</a> was developed by <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/vanguard-games/3010-7327/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-7327\">Vanguard Games</a> and 343 Industries Itt is a top down, \"twin stick\" shooter following the character <a href=\"/sarah-palmer/3005-24205/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-24205\">Sarah Palmer</a>, introduced in Halo 4.

The novel portrays a younger and newly promoted <i>Captain Jacob Keyes</i> and a <i>Dr. Catherine Halsey</i> on a mission to find subjects for the Spartan - II super soldier program.</p><p>While weeding through potential candidates, Halsey finds herself on Eridanus - II, watching a freckled face boy dominate his fellow elementary school classmates in a game of King of the Hill. As it turns out, this boy, <a href=\"../../master-chief/94-175/\" rel=\"nofollow \">John</a>, was exactly who she came to see. Halsey approaches the boy and proposes they play a game. She would flip a coin and if John could tell her which side it would land on before it hits the ground, the coin would be his. This was actually a test for the boy because it is the belief of Dr. Halsey that there is a great deal of luck involved in the outcome of a battle. As there are too many Spartan candidates as it is, she would use this test to weed out the \"lucky few\" who would enter into the program.</p><p>To her amazement, not only is John correct about the side on which the coin would land, but as the coin is spinning, he observes and calculates exactly which side it would be. With that John wins the coin and is later taken from his home, enrolled in the Spartan - II program, and replaced with an identical (although flawed clone) would continue to live as John for a short time before an \"accidental\" death.</p><p>John finds himself in a military base on Reach, the planet-made-headquarters of the USFN, the main military force of earth. Here, he meets the group of over 100 others chosen as the best of the best of humanity's children and destined to become their greatest asset. He is given the codename Spartan 117, being the 17th of the 2nd group of Spartans (after the failure of the first Spartan program). The group of future Spartans undergo a training program perfectly portraying that title, as they are pushed far past the limits of normal humans, and quickly pitted against the best squads the military has to offer in war games, during which the children are severely outnumbered and outgunned. In one such exercise, they (now teenagers) are separated in the frozen wilderness in an unpopulated region of the planet with no way to get home or contact each other. John finds each potential Spartan in turn and instructs them on how to survive the situation. Because of his leadership, everyone came back safely and without serious injury. For his performance, John was given the role of leader of the Spartans.</p><p>After becoming fully developed, the young adult Spartans are brought aboard a space station orbiting Reach to undergo a risky procedure to enhance their physical strength, speed, and reflexes well beyond the limits of a human. Here is where the luck Dr. Halsey tested him for as a child would come in handy as less than half of the Spartans survived the procedure without becoming too damaged to continue on as an effective soldier. The newly formed super-soldier squad was sent on few missions before John was given the military rank of Master Chief Petty Officer. While travelling to receive their specially made (and ridiculously expensive) Mjolnir IV armor. Before the Spartans arrive at their destination, their ship serves as the vessel for humanity's first encounter with the Covenant. Pitted against weapons no one has ever seen before, the ship barely escapes intact. After being given their armor and an all too brief tutorial on how it works, the Spartans are pitted against the Covenant who had followed them there. This first encounter ended in victory, but with the loss of one of John's closest friend, who had stayed behind to destroy the ship after his suit was compromised.</p><p>Over the next 20 years, Humanity's war with the covenant would ensue and in 2552, the Master Chief has a mission to capture and control a Covenant spaceship for research and analysis, with the aid of the Pillar of Autumn, commanded by Captain Keyes. However, the mission is soon interrupted when Reach is attacked by a Covenant armada. The Master Chief and the Spartans quickly go to aid the doomed planet. Unfortunately, the battle is deemed lost while Spartan 117 is battling the covenant aboard a space station. In order to survive, he is ordered to board the Pillar of Autumn, which, not even having enough time to calculate proper slipspace coordinates, jumps in order to escape as quickly as possible. As they make their escape, the survivors of Reach observe their former home being glassed by the <a href=\"../../the-covenant/92-81/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Covenant</a>, a procedure which uses Covenant ships to cook the surface of the planet from orbit, making it unlivable and literally turning the ground to glass. The Master Chief successfully escapes with the rest of the crew on the Pillar of Autumn, using the slipspace coordinates she acquired from a forerunner artifact discovered on Reach, but are unfortunately followed by a high ranking Covenant, command a fleet of ships. This leads to them to the discovery of <a href=\"../95-58/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Halo</a> and the beginning of <a href=\"../../halo-combat-evolved/61-2600/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Halo: Combat Evolved</a> along with the next book.</p><h3>Halo: The Flood</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-317738\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3808/317738-halo_the_flood_by_william_c_dietz_novel_cover.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.643598615917\" data-width=\"289\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 289px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:164.4%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3808/317738-halo_the_flood_by_william_c_dietz_novel_cover.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-317738\"><img alt=\"The Flood follows the adventure of Halo: Combat Evolved\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 289px) 100vw, 289px\" data-width=\"289\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/3808/317738-halo_the_flood_by_william_c_dietz_novel_cover.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/3808/317738-halo_the_flood_by_william_c_dietz_novel_cover.jpg 289w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Flood follows the adventure of Halo: Combat Evolved\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/3808/317738-halo_the_flood_by_william_c_dietz_novel_cover.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/3808/317738-halo_the_flood_by_william_c_dietz_novel_cover.jpg 289w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 289px) 100vw, 289px\" data-width=\"289\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Flood follows the adventure of Halo: Combat Evolved</figcaption></figure><p><u>Halo: The Flood</u> written in 2003 by <i>William Deitz,</i> follows the story arc of Halo: Combat Evolved, depicting in greater detail, the struggle between the human and the Covenant on a personal level. The novel opens in 2552, with the Pillar of Autumn crew discovering Halo and seemingly a Covenant fleet waiting for them. The Covenant refuse to engage in ship to ship combat, for fear of damaging the sacred ring. The aliens then board the Pillar of Autumn. Meanwhile, the Master Chief is being awoken from cryostasis in order to aid in the defense of the Pillar of Autumn. Once awoken the Master Chief receives Cortana from Captain Keyes with orders to prevent her capture. The Master Chief escapes from the damned ship on an escape pod, crash landing on Halo.</p><p>The novel then follows the Master Chief's endeavors, which can also be played in Halo: Combat Evolved. However the novel expands on the story with the character Major Antonio Silva and Melissa Mckay as they lead a group of ODST soldiers in combat against the Covenant. In a primary event of the game, Master Chief rescues Captain Keyes from the Covenant ship \"Truth and Reconciliation\". Keyes then reveals all the secrets of Halo he has overheard from conversations between the Covenant throughout his stay as their prisoner. While Master Chief is attempting to unearth the whereabouts of a lost squad, he comes across the helmet of Pvt. Wallace Jenkins. Using the video playback feature, the Master Chief uncovers the fate which befell the lost squad. This signals Spartan 117's first contact with the flood, a hive-minded parasite which reproduces by assimilating any living being it comes in contact with. Shortly afterword, 343 Guilty Spark (a.k.a. The Monitor) approaches the Master Chief and enlists him to help navigate the Library which contains the key needed to activate Halo, giving the Spartan the title of Reclaimer. Along the way, the Monitor implies that out of the 12 classes of armor available to the Forerunners, the Mjolnir V is equivalent to class 2.</p><p>As the Chief is about to activate the ring using the key he obtained from the Library, an infuriated Cortana stops him in his tracks. Subsequently, the true nature of Halo is unveiled, the ring does not eliminate the Flood, but instead destroys their food supply, or in other words, all sentient life in the galaxy. The Master Chief is then forced to defend himself against the Sentinels, the Halo security drones under the command of the Monitor, and proceeds to attempt to destroy the Halo, and if they could, escape from it. The most efficient way to destroy the ring is to cause a massive explosion by overloading the fusion reactors aboard the Pillar of Autumn. To do so, the Chief would need to retrieve protocol codes possessed by Captain Keyes. In the midst of a rescue attempt, he discovers Keys had become one of the Covenant and Master Chief is forced to kill his commanding officer. While the Pillar of Autumn's fusion reactors explode, the Chief and Cortana locate an intact space-worthy fighter vessel, given the codename \"Longsword\", contained in one of the Hangars of the massive crashed ship. The novel ends with the Master Chief in a Longsword, floating in dead space, and awaiting rescue.</p><p>Where the plot deviates from the game that shares its story is in the various scenarios not involving Spartan 117 including large scale battles between humans and Covenant, events which unfold after Master Chief leaves what would have been a level of the game. The most significant of these side-stories centers around a Covenant Grunt and Elite who frequently almost come in contact with Master Chief throughout the book before facing off with him near the end aboard the crashed Pillar of Autumn.</p><h3>Halo: First Strike</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1064379\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1064379-halofirststrike.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.6435406698565\" data-width=\"836\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 836px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:164.4%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1064379-halofirststrike.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1064379\"><img alt=\"Halo: First Strike fills the gap between the first two Halo games\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px\" data-width=\"389\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/5911/1064379-halofirststrike.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/5911/1064379-halofirststrike.jpg 836w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/1064379-halofirststrike.jpg 584w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/5911/1064379-halofirststrike.jpg 389w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Halo: First Strike fills the gap between the first two Halo games\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/5911/1064379-halofirststrike.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/5911/1064379-halofirststrike.jpg 836w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/1064379-halofirststrike.jpg 584w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/5911/1064379-halofirststrike.jpg 389w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px\" data-width=\"389\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Halo: First Strike fills the gap between the first two Halo games</figcaption></figure><p><u>Halo: First Strike</u> by <i>Eric Nylund</i> was written in 2003, transcribing the events that transpired between the first two Halo games. The novel starts right after the last scene in Halo: Combat Evolved with the Master Chief drifting off into space. Cortana soon finds a suspicious aircraft adrift in the wreckage remaining after the destruction of <a href=\"../95-58/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Installation 04</a>. On board, they discover <i>Corporal Locklear</i>, <i>Sergeant Johnson</i> and others. The <a href=\"../../master-chief/94-175/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Master Chief</a> initially suspects Johnson of being a flood form, since he saw him overcome on the Private Jenkins recording. It is later discovered that Sergeant Johnson's prolonged exposure to Plasma fire is his past has caused a unique immunity to the flood.</p><p>The Master Chief and his newly acquired squad commandeer a Covenant ship called Ascendant Justice while it is patrolling through the wreckage. The humans then pilot the ship to get back to Reach; upon arrival the Master Chief recognizes a signal their ship intercepts saying \"<i>Oly Oly Oxen Free</i>\", a signal which the Spartans used when they were in training on Reach. The Master Chief conjectures that there are surviving Spartans on the glassed planet. After landing, the Master Chief discovers several Spartans, Dr. Halsey and Vice Admiral Whitcomb; who ordered his own rescue during the battle for Reach. The reason for the Covenant not glassing this section of the planet perplexes everyone until it is revealed that the Covenant are seeking a Forerunner crystal. With the Covenant unwilling to damage the crystal in any way, the humans are able to avoid being fired upon for some time.</p><p>Meanwhile, Cortana still aboard the Ascendant Justice has uncovered that the Covenant have acquired the location of Earth and are preparing for an invasion. The humans arm a Nova Thermonuclear mine, which is capable of destroying a planet and escape to the Ascendant Justice using the gravity lift. Before escaping, the Covenant seriously damage the Ascendant Justice leaving only one plasma cannon capable of firing. Master Chief recalls the location of a rebel base (which he invaded on his first mission) hidden in an asteroid. The humans enlist the aid of the rebels for repairs and the impending Covenant attack. Dr. Halsey instructs Locklear to prevent the Covenant from acquiring the Forerunner crystal, then abducts the unconscious Kelly - 087 on one of the rebel ships, leaving the others confused and betrayed by her actions. Locklear acts on his orders by using explosives, resulting in his death as well. Fortunately, the destruction of the crystal ends the ability of the Covenant to track the ships movement. While the fall of Earth is imminent, the Spartans determine that any time possibly acquired by delaying the Covenant was well worth the cost. The Spartans then launch a covert attack on the Covenant space-station, <i>Unyielding Hierophant</i>, where the Covenant are amassing their ships for impending invasion*.</p><p>The Spartans set the space-station to self-destruct and escape, although losing one Spartan to their first Brute encounter. Vice Admiral Whitcomb then realizes his most heroic effort in his lifetime, he single-handedly baits the entire Covenant fleet to surround the <i>Unyielding Hierophant</i> at the time of the explosion, destroying almost all of the ships. While this effort would only hinder the Covenant effort, every hour bought for Earth's preparation would crucial for the defense of the last human sanctuary, Earth.</p><p><i>* The fact that the Covenant know the location of Earth and are prepared for the invasion of Earth is implied in this novel. However, this contradicts Cortana's acquired information at the beginning of Halo 2, when she uncovers the fact that the Covenant were surprised to find humans or any resistance on Earth.</i></p><h3>Halo: Ghosts of Onyx</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1064370\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1064370-halo_cover.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.4990892531876\" data-width=\"1647\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1647px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:149.9%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1064370-halo_cover.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1064370\"><img alt=\"Halo: Ghosts of Onyx\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" data-width=\"426\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/5911/1064370-halo_cover.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/5911/1064370-halo_cover.jpg 1647w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/0/5911/1064370-halo_cover.jpg 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/1064370-halo_cover.jpg 640w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/5911/1064370-halo_cover.jpg 426w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Halo: Ghosts of Onyx\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/5911/1064370-halo_cover.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/5911/1064370-halo_cover.jpg 1647w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/0/5911/1064370-halo_cover.jpg 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/1064370-halo_cover.jpg 640w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/5911/1064370-halo_cover.jpg 426w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" data-width=\"426\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Halo: Ghosts of Onyx</figcaption></figure><p><ins>Halo: Ghosts of Onyx</ins> (a.k.a.

The novel begins depicting a large-scale battle between the three hundred Spartan-IIIs and the Covenant. Due to unforeseen aptitude on the part of the Covenant, there were only two Spartan - III survivors, Lucy-B092 and Tom-B292. It is later unveiled that the Colonel James Ackerson is mass producing these Spartan - III's with little regard to preserving their lives; selecting children with less than ideal genetic code in order to keep production quotas. The Colonel chooses Chief Mendez (the trainer of the original Spartan-II program) to head up training for the Spartan - III's with the aid of Kurt-051. Under the new name of Lieutenant Kurt Ambrose and a faked death courtesy of ONI, Kurt-051 is able to proceed with training the new Spartan-IIIs, unbeknownst to his fellow Spartan-II's.</p><p>While the Spartan-III's are performing a training exercise on Onyx, some suspicious activity occurs in a forbidden sector.

The Jackals are attempting to steal navigational data from Ignatio Delgado, the one of the protagonists in the novel. While holding off the Jackals, Delgado is almost killed, but saved by SPARTAN-111 (Adrianna) of the Grey Team. She hands him a beacon, which would signal her team to get the data if he would no longer be capable of keeping it from the Covenant. She also tells him to keep Gray Team a secret from the Security Council, the leading group of the Insurrectionist in The Rubble.</p><p>Meanwhile, Commander Dmitri Zheng informs Lieutenant <a href=\"../../jacob-keyes/94-1580/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Jacob Keyes</a> that he is being transferred from teaching at the Academy to assist Zheng in enforcing the new Cole Protocol.

Suspecting that Bonifacio, a known smuggler and on the Security Council, Delgado proceeds to attempt to obtain information from him. While trying to get information, he meets Adrianna again in a small bar. While talking, they are attacked by Insurrectionists, who overhear the questioning. Again saved by Adrianna, Delgado is taken to the Spartans' ship to meet with Jai and Mike, other Spartan II's.</p><p>Back on the Midsummer Night, commanded by Dmitri Zheng with Jacob Keyes on board, the UNSC soldiers attempt to enforce the Cole Protocol on a civilian freighter. With the civilian refusing to cooperate, Keyes and a group of ODST (Orbital Drop Shock Troopers) board the freighter. With the men aboard, the civilian captain detonates a bomb on the ship killing many men. Attempting to escape, Keyes puts on the armor of a fallen ODST and jumps into space. He is able to contact the Midsummer Night alert them of the attack.</p><p>However, the hidden Insurrectionists aboard the civilian ship detonate the ship to kill as many of retreating ODSTs as possible.

The Ship AI Mo Ye wakes Baird and informs him of the situation. She explains that Baird has to prevent the Covenant from getting access to her Data &amp; the Ships Navigational database or else they will find the location of all the UNSC's colonies.</p><p>Baird then sets out to work his way to the control room to activate the self-destruct sequence. Armed with only a fire-extinguisher he is stabbed by an elite who casts his body aside presuming Baird is dead. Upon waking, Baird is given a fatal-concoction of drugs by Mo Ye. These will make his responses faster and improve his strength for the next 2 hours. Renewed, Baird makes it to the Control Room where he surrenders to the Covenant there, proclaiming he'll give them Earth's location for his safety.

Master Chief's history is revealed in great detail in the Halo novel <i>The Fall of Reach.</i> He was originally named John and was born in the year 2511 and lived on the colony of Eridanus II which was near the edge of UNSC controlled space. From a very young age he exhibited some uncanny characteristics, for instance he was much larger than any other Child his age, smarter and more was in general much more developed than his peers. When John was six years old, 74 children were secretly kidnapped by the United Nations Space Command (UNSC) to participate in the Spartan-II project, which sought to create a new breed of cybernetic super soldier.</p><p>The kidnapped children were \"flash cloned\" by the UNSC so that the parents of the children never even knew they were kidnapped. Upon their arrival on the <a href=\"../../reach/95-571/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Planet Reach</a>, they were given new names and Master Chief was designated as John-117. Eight years later, all of the Spartan-II subjects underwent psychological, biological and cybernetic enhancements but only John and 32 others survived. These remaining Spartans donned their trademark <a href=\"../../mjolnir-armor/93-33/\" rel=\"nofollow \">MJOLNIR</a> armor and entered into military service after completing the project and went on to face the deadly Halo antagonists the <a href=\"../../the-covenant/92-81/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Covenant</a>, the <a href=\"../../the-flood/92-645/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Flood</a> . Master Chief's armored, faceless visage has become iconic and synonymous with the Halo franchise. Among other things, his MJOLNIR suit gives him advanced protection from damage, a recharging shield system, and enhanced jumping abilities.</p><p><b>Service History</b></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-555899\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/217/555899-halo_2008_08_14_01_51_16_57.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"800\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/217/555899-halo_2008_08_14_01_51_16_57.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-555899\"><img alt=\"Master Chief - Halo: CE\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/217/555899-halo_2008_08_14_01_51_16_57.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/217/555899-halo_2008_08_14_01_51_16_57.jpg 800w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/217/555899-halo_2008_08_14_01_51_16_57.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Master Chief - Halo: CE\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/217/555899-halo_2008_08_14_01_51_16_57.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/217/555899-halo_2008_08_14_01_51_16_57.jpg 800w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/217/555899-halo_2008_08_14_01_51_16_57.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Master Chief - Halo: CE</figcaption></figure><p>After a surprise attack on the planet <a href=\"../../reach/95-571/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Reach</a> where almost the entire Spartan-II force was located at the time, most of the Spartan-II's were killed although a handful survived.

This level marks the first occasion that the player plays as someone other than the Master Chief.

At the end of the level he meets up with Sgt. Johnson and escorts the Scarab and breaks into the control room where Tartarus is trying to force Miranda Keyes to activate the ring.

For all general purposes the Arbiter plays no significant role gameplay wise, he will assist on you on certain missions but that is the extent of his contribution and the Arbiter is a non playable character in the Halo 3. However, he is by default the leader of the Elites and the Covenant Separatists. He accompanies Master Chief to the Ark and for the Prophets betrayal he seeks to kill Truth. He accomplishes that along with the Master Chief's help and also helps in stopping Gravemind and the flood by setting off the ring over the Ark. He is last seen crashing on Earth, as his front part of the ship gets through the portal in one piece. He is present at the \"memorial\" on Earth and is seen leaving for the Elite home world of Sanghelios.</p><h2>Antagonists</h2><h3>The Covenant</h3><p><a href=\"../../the-covenant/92-81/\" rel=\"nofollow \">The Covenant</a> is a collection of alien races ruled by the Prophets that have been waging a successful war against humanity. They include many species such as the Grunts, Jackals, Brutes, Hunters, Drones, Engineers (only in the Halo novels) and the ruling class, the Prophets. They also included the Elites, but they were cast out of the Covenant in 2552 in a bloody civil war that in turn forced the elites to ally with the humans. The races are all bound together by their unquestioned belief in the long extinct forerunners and their promise of the great journey. In that sense they follow the prophets who claim that they can lead them to this promise land. The leader of the Covenant was the Prophet of truth until he was executed by the Arbiter in the events in Halo 3. With the majority of their fleets decimated and facing both political and cultural upheaval, Jul' Mdama leads the Covenant Remnant after the war, thus beginning a Second Human-Covenant War.</p><p><u><b>Prophets</b></u></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-413284\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5150/413284-prophet_of_truth.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5150/413284-prophet_of_truth.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-413284\"><img alt=\"Prophet of Truth\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/5150/413284-prophet_of_truth.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/5150/413284-prophet_of_truth.jpg 1024w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/0/5150/413284-prophet_of_truth.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/5150/413284-prophet_of_truth.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Prophet of Truth\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/5150/413284-prophet_of_truth.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/5150/413284-prophet_of_truth.jpg 1024w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/0/5150/413284-prophet_of_truth.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/5150/413284-prophet_of_truth.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Prophet of Truth</figcaption></figure><ul><li><u>Truth</u> was the highest of the three ruling Covenant Prophets.

The Precursors picked humanity for the Mantle of resposibility. The Forerunners got angry and exterminated the Precursors. The race came from Ghibalb. When humanity had an interstellar empire and teamed up with the San Shyumm (Prophets), the Forerunners believed that humans might have overpopulated. In truth, the humans migrated from the Flood. The Forerunners thought the humans were a threat. The war lasted for over a millennium. The result was humans exiled and devolved at Erde-Tyrene (Earth) and the San Shyumm never allying the humans. After the war, the Ur-Didact proposed the construction of Shield Worlds and Faber creating the Halo Array which consisted of twelve.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-340231\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5150/340231-46172909_343gs.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.0733333333333\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:107.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5150/340231-46172909_343gs.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-340231\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/5150/340231-46172909_343gs.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/5150/340231-46172909_343gs.jpg 300w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/5150/340231-46172909_343gs.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/5150/340231-46172909_343gs.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"></noscript></a></figure><ul><li><b>343 Guilty Spark</b><br />343 Guilty Spark is an Artificial Intelligence created by the Forerunners. Part of him is from a human named Chakas. He is the monitor, historian, and caretaker of Installation 04, also simply known as Halo. His job was to protect the Halo ring, as well as assist a Reclaimer in the event of a Flood outbreak. Guilty Spark is first encountered at the end of the level \"343 Guilty Spark\" in Halo: CE, where he finds the Master Chief battling Flood in the bog outside Halo's Library. Believing the Chief to be a \"Reclaimer\", the Monitor transports him inside the Library. From this point forward, Guilty Spark remains certain that Master Chief is a Reclaimer, and so should already know all there is to know about the Flood and Forerunners. He expresses considerable surprise whenever the Chief deviates from the Forerunner's established Flood-control protocol. It's never actually explained why Guilty Spark believes the Chief to be a Reclaimer. However, it is speculated that because Humans apparently descended from the Foreunners, and because Master Chief is always encased inside his armor, Guilty Spark may have mistaken Master Chief for a Forerunner. At the end of Halo 3, it is the Master Chief that partially destroys Guilty Spark, after Spark turned on him to try and protect his newly constructed Halo. When he retreated in 2557, he was contacted by ONI and told them about the Forerunners' history and the Ur-Didact.</li></ul><h2>Important Locations</h2><h3>Halo</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-10661\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/25/10661-290px-Installation_05.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.75172413793103\" data-width=\"290\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 290px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.2%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/25/10661-290px-Installation_05.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-10661\"><img alt=\"Halo firing\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 290px) 100vw, 290px\" data-width=\"290\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png 290w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Halo firing\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png 290w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 290px) 100vw, 290px\" data-width=\"290\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Halo firing</figcaption></figure><p>The <a href=\"../95-58/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Halo</a> array is the last line of defense of an ancient race, known as the <a href=\"../../the-forerunners/92-80/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Forerunners</a>, and was built about 100,000 years before the first Halo game takes place. The Forerunners stumbled onto the Flood, an aggressively violent alien race that could bind itself to sentient life and thus spread rapidly. The Forerunners battled the Flood as best they could but were unable to defeat them, so to save the rest of the galaxy from being overtaken, Faber (Master Builder) constructed numerous Halo arrays. The Halos were built to research and contain the Flood, but if the beasts became too numerous, the Halos could all be activated and used to kill off all sentient life in the galaxy, depriving the Flood of food and thus eradicating them. The Halo array was activated once by the Forerunner known as IsoDidact.</p><p>The Halo rings are one of a kind in the sense that they are technological marvels that cannot be equaled, not even by the Covenant. For all purposes they are small planets and have on them a wide variety or environments, ranging from Deserts to luscious rain forests. They also have some local wildlife and are \"staffed\" by sentinels and each of the 7 rings has a monitor attached to it. It is the monitors duty to maintain the ring and keep it in good working condition, so that if the need arises it could be fired with no hiccups.</p><p>Since the true purpose of the ring is a gory one, Faber constructed it in a way that made sure that those who wished to activate it knew of the consequences. As such, every Halo ring had a central control room from which the ring could be fired, however to do so would require that he or she acquire the index, which was placed in the Library. Also, the Forerunners decided to place the monumental and suicidal task of activating the rings, not on the installation's monitors or the sentinels but rather on the \"reclaimers\"</p><p>It also seems that the Halos were a place to study the flood and probably try to research some kind of drug to neutralize them. That would explain the large number of Flood specimens that were found in the Halos. While the seven Halo's were scattered throughout the galaxy, there was a central structure, the <a href=\"../../the-ark/95-125/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Ark</a> that could be used to activate them all at the same time. The Ark was located outside the galaxy and required that a portal be activated on Earth so as to get to it.</p><h2>Science and Technology</h2><h3>Weaponry</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-876772\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7473/876772-glassingship.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7473/876772-glassingship.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-876772\"><img alt=\"Plasma Torpedo, primary weapon of the Covenant warships\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/7473/876772-glassingship.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7473/876772-glassingship.jpg 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/0/7473/876772-glassingship.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/7473/876772-glassingship.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/7473/876772-glassingship.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Plasma Torpedo, primary weapon of the Covenant warships\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/7473/876772-glassingship.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7473/876772-glassingship.jpg 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/0/7473/876772-glassingship.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/7473/876772-glassingship.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/7473/876772-glassingship.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Plasma Torpedo, primary weapon of the Covenant warships</figcaption></figure><p>The UNSC relies heavily on advanced ballistic technology in nearly every facet of it's military arsenal, including the ship-based weaponry.

Marty O'Donnell has said that the <i>e minor</i> chord holds the heart of the halo score. In Halo 1 many of the themes where established, but simple and airy. Halo 2 strengthened the themes and added many more orchestral layers to the mix. Halo 3 has a darker twist on those same themes adding baritone vocalists and an emphases on drums that created a more war like sound. In ODST the game abandons the previous halo themes almost completely, there is no choral music.</p><p>The Music is a quieter more jazz-influenced sound. O'Donnell said that since the game tells \"a human story, not a cyborg story (The score should be) \"more intimate and personal. Two of the game's three hours of music are packaged in a two disc soundtrack and were released September 22.</p><p>Most of the music for ODST and Halo 3 was recorded in Washington state and performed by The Northwest Sinfonia.

The Metroid Prime of the series' namesake is a mutated Metroid that has been living off absorbed Phazon for an extended period of time. Although defeated by Samus in the first game of the series, the Prime Metroid's essence lives on through the Phazon it has become dependent on, and, after ripping Samus' Phazon enhancement from her power suit, is reborn in her image as the creature known as Dark Samus, who is a principal antagonist in the two subsequent games. The games center around Dark Samus' hunger for Phazon, culminating in a battle between Samus and Dark Samus on the birthplace of Phazon itself, planet Phaaze. Side stories in the series involve the Space Pirates and their discovery and study of Phazon and its properties, as well as its effects on Metroids and other fauna, and the plight of the Luminoth on the planet Aether, a planet being ripped between two dimensions through the corrupting power of the Phazon on the planets surface.</p><p>Metroid 2: Return of Samus picks up after the Prime series. After disposing of the Phazon threat, Samus is then charged with going to the Metroid homeworld and eradicating every last Metroid in existence, the Galactic Federation deeming them too dangerous to be allowed to exist. At the end of the game, Samus finds an infant Metroid that believes she is its mother, and brings it back to the Galactic Federation for safekeeping.</p><p>In Super Metroid, the Space Pirates assault the science vessel carrying the last infant Metroid and steal it away back to planet Zebes to continue their studies on the dangerous lifeforms. Samus must again fight her way through Zebes' defenses, native flora and fauna, and the Space Pirates to reach Mother Brain and retrieve the infant Metroid.</p><p>Metroid: Other M tells a story that helped bridge the gap between Super Metroid and Metroid Fusion. While out in space, Samus hears a distress call, and heads towards it. It leads her to a space station called the Bottle Ship. On it, she encounters familiar faces as she meets a squad from the Galactic Federation, who were deployed to the Bottle Ship for a confidential mission. Among these faces is Adam Malkovich, Samus's former Commanding Officer. Samus teams up with the squad, and together they investigate this mysterious space station. Throughout their investigation, they find many secrets that were never meant to be seen by anyone outside the Bottle Ship's crew.</p><p>In Metroid Fusion, the story picks up with Samus acting as a bodyguard to Galactic Federation scientists on their return to the Metroid home planet first visited in Metroid 2: Return of Samus. There, Samus is attacked by a life form known as the X Parasites, a former prey of the Metroids that are now flourishing on the planet. Samus is nearly killed by this attack, and to save her life, Galactic Federation Scientists have to inject her with the DNA of the infant Metroid, allowing her body to absorb the X Parasites, much like the Metroids themselves could. Her old powersuit becomes infected by the X however, becoming a sentient being known as the SA-X, who infects the entire space station with the parasite. Samus must eradicate and absorb all the X parasites to counter the threat.</p><h3>Other Games In The Series</h3><p>Metroid Prime: Hunters occurs after the events of Metroid Prime. It is a sub-story of the main Metroid theme, centering around Samus and her rival bounty hunters' search for the 'Ultimate Power' rumored to exist in the remote Alimbic Cluster in the Tetra Galaxy. Metroid Prime: Hunters is primarily a multiplayer focused game, pitting players against each other in arena style deathmatches.</p><p>Metroid Prime: Pinball is a pinball game with Metroid-themed tables, and as such has no connection to the main story other than the characters, locations and themes it takes from the games to make creative pinball tables.</p>", "guid": "3025-3", "name": "Metroid"}, {"description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Developed by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1088\" href=\"/blizzard-entertainment-inc/3010-1088/\">Blizzard Entertainment</a>, Warcraft is an award winning, genre-crossing and highly celebrated series of real-time strategy and massively multiplayer online role-playing games. Set in a high-fantasy universe populated by humans, orcs, goblins, trolls, undead, elves, dwarves, gnomes and others, the Warcraft series has consistently impressed players with solid gameplay, impressive visuals, and an epic storyline that has fostered a deep and almost fanatical fanbase of at least 10 million players.</p><h2>Warcraft: Orcs and Humans</h2><table class=\"t-editor full-width with-out-border\"><tbody><tr><td><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2605/317182-front_cover.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-317182\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.2783357245337\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:127.8%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2605/317182-front_cover.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-317182\"><img alt=\"Warcraft: Orcs and Humans\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/2605/317182-front_cover.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/2605/317182-front_cover.jpg 697w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/2605/317182-front_cover.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/2605/317182-front_cover.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" data-width=\"500\"></a><figcaption>Warcraft: Orcs and Humans</figcaption></figure>A real-time strategy game released in 1994 for PC and Macintosh, <a href=\"../../warcraft-orcs-humans/61-9719/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Warcraft: Orcs and Humans</a> features two opposing factions, the brutish orcs and the noble humans.

Blizzard increased the graphical resolution significantly, and produced units, structures and terrain as large, colorful sprites. Naval combat was first introduced to the series in Warcraft II. Additionally, the game was highly customizable, leading to the development of several third-party applications by fans which were subsequently adopted for internal use by Blizzard. Like the first game, players could control either the forces of the humans or orcs. However, other likeminded races joined the respective armies. For example, the humans were joined by elves, gnomes, and dwarves, while the orcs were joined by trolls, ogres, and goblins.<br /><br />Warcraft II is set six years after its predecessor, and assumes the orcs were victorious at the end of the first game. The land of Azeroth has fallen, and the human armies are retreating under the onslaught of the orcish Hordes. The orcs, however, driven by war and conflict, constructed a massive armada of ships with which to invade the lands of Lordaeron and finish off their human enemy. Eventually, humanity and its allies prevail, reclaiming Azeroth and destroying the Dark Portal, the original gateway that allowed the orcs into the human world from the dimension of Draenor. Unfortunately, the dimensional rift itself was not closed, allowing the orcs to begin a second invasion in the next game.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Warcraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal</h2><table class=\"t-editor full-width with-out-border\"><tbody><tr><td><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1379/895575-untitled_1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-895575\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.2853470437018\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:128.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1379/895575-untitled_1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-895575\"><img alt=\"Warcraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 497px) 100vw, 497px\" data-width=\"497\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/1379/895575-untitled_1.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/1379/895575-untitled_1.png 389w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Warcraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/1379/895575-untitled_1.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/1379/895575-untitled_1.png 389w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 497px) 100vw, 497px\" data-width=\"497\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Warcraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal</figcaption></figure>This expansion pack for Warcraft II was the only released Warcraft game jointly developed between Blizzard Entertainment and another studio ( <a href=\"../../cyberlore-studios-inc/65-796/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Cyberlore Studios</a>). <a href=\"../../warcraft-ii-beyond-the-dark-portal/61-11816/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Beyond the Dark Portal</a> took players into a new dimension, to the orc home dimension of Draenor, in an effort to seal the dimensional rift in the world of its origin, and forever prevent another invasion of Azeroth from the orcish Horde.

Naval combat was removed entirely, two levels of fog of war were added, line-of-sight and elevation damage bonuses were included, and hero units were made the primary focus of gameplay. Additionally, the game provided four races for players to control (humans, orcs, night elves, and the undead). No longer was the player tasked with building massive armies of units; now the game focused on role-playing elements to bolster the abilities of Hero units, which then amassed smaller groups of units around them.<br /><br />In the Warcraft III, a devastating enemy of ancient prophecy, the demonic Burning Legion, arrives on Azeroth to consume the world and destroy all that live there. The player plays as one of the four races involved in the conflict to determine the outcome of the war. In past Warcraft games, each race's campaign was presented as an alternate version of the same timeline. In Warcraft III, however, each of the four races' campaigns happen in a specific sequence and are meant to be played in that sequence to convey one linear storyline.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne</h2><table class=\"t-editor full-width with-out-border\"><tbody><tr><td><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5872/474296-tftbox2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-474296\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.3895486935867\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:139.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5872/474296-tftbox2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-474296\"><img alt=\"Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px\" data-width=\"460\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/5872/474296-tftbox2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/5872/474296-tftbox2.jpg 421w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/5872/474296-tftbox2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/5872/474296-tftbox2.jpg 421w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px\" data-width=\"460\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne</figcaption></figure>Taking place immediately after Warcraft III, <a href=\"../../warcraft-iii-the-frozen-throne/61-14073/\" rel=\"nofollow \">The Frozen Throne</a> expansion pack continued the story of the exiled night elf <a href=\"../../illidan-stormrage/94-637/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Illidan Stormrage</a> and the corrupted paladin <a href=\"../../arthas-menethil/94-636/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Arthas Menethil</a>.

The game takes place after the events of Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne, and allows player (with currently available and planned expansion packs) to travel across the majority of the Warcraft universe.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade</h2><table class=\"t-editor full-width with-out-border\"><tbody><tr><td><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1379/948070-uk.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-948070\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.4115384615385\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:141.2%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1379/948070-uk.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-948070\"><img alt=\"World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px\" data-width=\"453\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/1379/948070-uk.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/1379/948070-uk.jpg 520w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/1379/948070-uk.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/1379/948070-uk.jpg 453w\"><noscript><img alt=\"World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/1379/948070-uk.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/1379/948070-uk.jpg 520w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/1379/948070-uk.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/1379/948070-uk.jpg 453w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px\" data-width=\"453\"></noscript></a><figcaption>World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade</figcaption></figure>The first expansion pack to World of Warcraft, <a href=\"../../world-of-warcraft-the-burning-crusade/61-18603/\" rel=\"nofollow \">The Burning Crusade</a> adds two new races to create characters with, several new instances (i.e. lands and dungeons) to embark upon, a new battleground for player vs. player combat, and potentially dozens of hours of new content for players overall.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King</h2><table class=\"t-editor full-width with-out-border\"><tbody><tr><td><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4344/907244-wrath01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-907244\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.4148936170213\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:141.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4344/907244-wrath01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-907244\"><img alt=\"World of Warcraft: Warth of the Lich King\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 452px) 100vw, 452px\" data-width=\"452\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4344/907244-wrath01.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/4344/907244-wrath01.jpg 658w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4344/907244-wrath01.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4344/907244-wrath01.jpg 452w\"><noscript><img alt=\"World of Warcraft: Warth of the Lich King\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4344/907244-wrath01.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/4344/907244-wrath01.jpg 658w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4344/907244-wrath01.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4344/907244-wrath01.jpg 452w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 452px) 100vw, 452px\" data-width=\"452\"></noscript></a><figcaption>World of Warcraft: Warth of the Lich King</figcaption></figure><a href=\"../../world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/61-20701/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Wrath of the Lich King</a> is the second expansion pack to World of Warcraft, and involves characters and events which took place within Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne.

GTA left it's mark as it was one of the few games at the time which rewarded criminal or anarchistic behavior (others of the era included <a href=\"/postal/3030-15891/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15891\">Postal</a> and <a href=\"/carmageddon/3030-18394/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18394\">Carmageddon</a>), and for being unabashedly violent. GTA used a top-down point of view, with the camera set about 40 or 50 feet above the ground and locked on the player's character who always stayed in the center of the screen. There is a chapter system which places players in the role of one of eight different characters across three cities - <a href=\"/liberty-city/3035-15/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-15\">Liberty City</a>, <a href=\"/san-andreas/3035-17/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-17\">San Andreas</a>, and <a href=\"/vice-city/3035-16/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-16\">Vice City</a>. The game focuses more on the completion of stand-alone missions in each chapter rather than any substantial overarching narrative. In each city, the player is given the goal of earning a specific amount of money, which can be done in any number of ways: killing people, blowing up cars, stealing cars and selling them, completing missions for a variety of criminals and low-lifes, even rapidly killing lines of jogging Hare Krishna monks (which the game enthusiastically calls a GOURANGA!). Players can also use their own music in the game in place of the seven radio stations, and the PC version allows for multiplayer gameplay over a network. Two mission pack expansions were later released:</p><p><u><strong>Grand Theft Auto: London 1969</strong></u></p><p>This mission pack is one of only two GTA games to explicitly take place in a real city (the other being GTA London, 1961). <a href=\"/grand-theft-auto-london-1969/3030-8294/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8294\">GTA: London 1969</a> was released two years after the first game for multiple platforms, and was built on the same engine, reusing the same format of mission-structured gameplay inside a non-linear <a href=\"/\">sandbox</a> environment.</p><ul><li><u><strong>Grand Theft Auto: London 1961</strong></u><br />Coming only two months after its predecessor, <a href=\"/grand-theft-auto-london-1961/3030-20105/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20105\">London 1961</a> was released to GTA fans as a free download from the Rockstar North website, only for the PC version of GTA.

GTA 2 included several \"firsts\" for the franchise, including the implementation of a story and plot based on a singular character, use of day and night modes (which would later be expanded on in <a href=\"/grand-theft-auto-iii/3030-3724/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3724\">Grand Theft Auto III</a> as a <a href=\"/daynight-cycle/3015-92/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-92\">day/night cycle</a>), as well as the first inclusion of some recurring elements of future games, like the Zaibatsu Corporation and several different criminal organizations that the player must deal with throughout the course of the game (Yakuza, Russian Mafia).</p><h3><b><a href=\"/grand-theft-auto-iii/3030-3724/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3724\">Grand Theft Auto III</a></b></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2130/636368-gta3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-636368\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.3910761154856\" data-width=\"381\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 381px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:139.1%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2130/636368-gta3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-636368\"><img alt=\"Grand Theft Auto III\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px\" data-width=\"460\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/2130/636368-gta3.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/2130/636368-gta3.jpg 381w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Grand Theft Auto III\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/2130/636368-gta3.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/2130/636368-gta3.jpg 381w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px\" data-width=\"460\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Grand Theft Auto III</figcaption></figure><p><b>Original Release Date:</b> October 22, 2001</p><p><b>Platforms:</b> PS2, PC, Xbox</p><p>Released to much anticipation in 2001, <a href=\"/grand-theft-auto-iii/3030-3724/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3724\">Grand Theft Auto III</a> represented a significant shift in the franchise, with major ramifications for gaming as a whole. It pushed the medium to new graphical and technical heights, massively popularized its style of open-ended sandbox gameplay, and grabbed the attention of the non-gaming press for its excessive violence. While initially depicted from a top-down point of view, <a href=\"/liberty-city/3035-15/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-15\">Liberty City</a> was now reimagined as a vibrant, enormous, and fully 3D world, filled with people going about their business by car and on foot. Players took on the role of a nameless protagonist (retroactively named Claude in <a href=\"/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas/3030-7120/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7120\">GTA: San Andreas</a>), who, after robbing a bank with his girlfriend, is betrayed by her, shot, and left for dead. He's subsequently arrested, convicted, and sent to prison. The player escapes during an attack on a police convoy aimed at freeing an unrelated prisoner, and runs off with a fellow escapee, who puts the player in touch with the right people, starting him on a life of crime as a thug for various Liberty City gangs, criminal syndicates and powerful individuals.</p><p>Grand Theft Auto III was notoriously attacked by mass media outlets for having excessive violence, allowing the player to kill police officers, old women, and just about anyone else that could be found in the game. (It didn't help that the game was released around the time of the September 11th attacks). Of particular moral outrage was the ability of the player to pick up and have sex with a prostitute (implied through sound effects and the car rocking back and fourth), and then optionally kill the prostitute to recollect his money. As a result of the controversies over GTA III's mature content, the game was banned in Australia, and gave renewed impetus to studying, debating, and often decrying the effect of violent media on children and society at large.</p><h3><b><a href=\"/grand-theft-auto-iv/3030-20457/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20457\">Grand Theft Auto IV</a></b></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/23/9673-gta4_box.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-9673\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.2505399568035\" data-width=\"463\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 463px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:125.1%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/23/9673-gta4_box.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-9673\"><img alt=\"Grand Theft Auto IV\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 511px) 100vw, 511px\" data-width=\"511\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/23/9673-gta4_box.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/23/9673-gta4_box.jpg 463w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Grand Theft Auto IV\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/23/9673-gta4_box.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/23/9673-gta4_box.jpg 463w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 511px) 100vw, 511px\" data-width=\"511\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Grand Theft Auto IV</figcaption></figure><p><b>Original Release Date:</b> April 29, 2008</p><p><b>Platforms:</b> PS3, Xbox 360, PC</p><p>GTA IV once again returns players to <a href=\"/liberty-city/3035-15/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-15\">Liberty City</a>, only in the most detailed version yet, built to resemble New York City. <a href=\"/grand-theft-auto-iv/3030-20457/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20457\">GTA IV</a> integrated several recent advances in technology, including Rockstar's new and revamped RAGE engine (previously used for <a href=\"/rockstar-games-presents-table-tennis/3030-16770/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16770\">Rockstar Games presents Table Tennis</a>) and Euphoria physics and motion technology.

The franchise has undergone a significant change in this latest iteration, with an exceptionally strong and critically acclaimed story, advanced vehicle physics and pedestrian behavior, re-worked third-person combat gameplay, and for the first time on consoles, online multiplayer content.

Developed in an enhanced version of GTA III's engine, Vice City similarly depicted an active, vibrant city, dotted with skyscrapers, hotels, pedestrians, various businesses, and vehicles. In <a href=\"/grand-theft-auto-vice-city/3030-17036/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17036\">GTA: Vice City</a>, players take on the role of mafia thug <a href=\"/tommy-vercetti/3005-14/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14\">Tommy Vercetti</a>, originally a Liberty City-based mobster, recently released from prison and sent to Vice City to oversee a drug deal. Half-way through the deal, the participating parties are ambushed, with the attacker making off with both the drugs and the money. Tommy vows to retrieve the money or die trying. As Tommy tries to find out who stole his money and how to get it back, he gets involved in several avenues of \"business\" that allow him to rise up and form his own crime syndicate. GTA: Vice City was noted for having many more vehicles the player could control (including helicopters, motorcycles, and boats), as well as several graphical improvements over its predecessor, including better lighting and sharper textures. Several modifications adding multiplayer over the internet were released for the PC version, and the game was just as if not more controversial then GTA III, being cited for racism and inciting genocide against Cubans and Haitians.</p><h3><b><a href=\"/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas/3030-7120/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7120\">Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</a></b></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/239/754320-saxboxusfrontcover.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-754320\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4266666666667\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:142.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/239/754320-saxboxusfrontcover.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-754320\"><img alt=\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 448px) 100vw, 448px\" data-width=\"448\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/239/754320-saxboxusfrontcover.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/239/754320-saxboxusfrontcover.jpg 600w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/239/754320-saxboxusfrontcover.jpg 448w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/239/754320-saxboxusfrontcover.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/239/754320-saxboxusfrontcover.jpg 600w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/239/754320-saxboxusfrontcover.jpg 448w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 448px) 100vw, 448px\" data-width=\"448\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</figcaption></figure><p><b>Original Release Date:</b> October 26, 2004 <b>Platforms:</b> PS2, PC, Xbox, Xbox 360 (Games On Demand)</p><p>Probably the most controversial game in the franchise, <a href=\"/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas/3030-7120/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7120\">Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</a> is also the largest in scope. Players fill the shoes of <a href=\"/carl-johnson/3005-329/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-329\">Carl \"CJ\" Johnson</a>, as he returns home from <a href=\"/liberty-city/3035-15/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-15\">Liberty City</a> and slowly picks apart the reasoning behind his mother's murder while establishing a small criminal empire based around the revitalization of his old gang as well as various businesses and individuals he encounters throughout the course of the game. Unlike previous titles, which occurred within the confines of a single city, San Andreas represents the borders of an entire state, made to represent parts of California and Nevada. The player travels between three cities, each of which corresponds to a real location. <a href=\"/los-santos/3035-19/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-19\">Los Santos</a> (Los Angeles), <a href=\"/san-fierro/3035-20/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-20\">San Fierro</a> (San Francisco), and <a href=\"/las-venturas/3035-18/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-18\">Las Venturas</a> (Las Vegas). GTA: San Andreas is noted for having even more vehicles available for the player to control than <a href=\"/vice-city/3035-16/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-16\">Vice City</a>, as well as diverse cast of celebrities supplying the voice for many important characters, such as <a href=\"/samuel-l-jackson/3040-89768/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-89768\">Samuel L. Jackson</a>, Andy Dick, <a href=\"/james-woods/3040-44552/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-44552\">James Woods</a>, Peter Fonda, <a href=\"/charlie-murphy/3040-89875/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-89875\">Charlie Murphy</a>, and Axl Rose. Additionally, the game provided several minigames, allowed the player to participate in or incite gang wars, allowed cars to be modified, and let the player commit robbery in the form of home-invasion. GTA: San Andreas also included a diverse system of RPG mechanics, letting players increase CJ's speed and strength, improve his weapon handling and unarmed combat techniques, change his clothing and haircuts, and otherwise modify his appearance, to which NPC pedestrians will react differently, insulting or complimenting him accordingly.</p><ul><li><u><strong>Hot Coffee</strong></u><br />Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas created what was at the time the most pressing controversial video-game issue to ever appear in mass media publications by inadvertently allowing players to engage in a crudely rendered, fully naked sex minigame, in which the player comes into their in-game girlfriend's house to get a cup of joe, but ends up engaging in sexual intercourse. This explicit mini-game was actually excluded by Rockstar, who accidentally left the source code in the game. Someone hacked the finished game and brought to light what is now called the \"Hot Coffee\" mod. Rockstar initially denied creating the minigame, but shortly thereafter versions making use of the Action Replay service for both Xbox and PS2 were released onto the internet, gaining the attention of several United States politicians, lawyers, parent groups, and social organizations, eventually resulting in the game's recall, modification and re-release.

Most of the games are fantasy action-adventure games, usually in an top-down view or third-person. The franchise was created by Shigeru Miyamoto (of Mario fame) and Takashi Tezuka.</p><p>The games are developed and published under Nintendo, but a few are developed by <a href=\"/capcom/3010-367/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-367\">Capcom</a>'s in-house development studios, and there were three titles on the <a href=\"/philips-interactive-media-inc/3010-48/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-48\">Philips</a> <a href=\"/cd-i/3045-27/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-27\">CD-i</a>. Most of the games share gameplay, with puzzle-solving, action, adventure, some RPG elements, and sometimes some other aspects.</p><p>All games in the franchise center around <a href=\"/link/3005-191/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-191\">Link</a> (although it is rarely the same Link) saving the <a href=\"/zelda/3005-5/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5\">Princess Zelda</a> (again, rarely the same Zelda), and fighting a menace, usually <a href=\"/ganon/3005-512/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-512\">Ganondorf/Ganon</a> or another monster akin to him. The games also typically take place in the fictional land of <a href=\"/hyrule/3035-13/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-13\">Hyrule</a>, although it has been in other lands too. The <a href=\"/triforce/3055-18/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-18\">Triforce</a> is a key object that appears in nearly every Legend of Zelda game, which is an object that is built by the gods of Hyrule.</p><p>The Legend of Zelda franchise has sold around 52 million copies since the release of the original The Legend of Zelda. The series has fourteen games in all in the main series, although there have been various spin-offs and Japanese-only games, as well as some unofficial games on the CD-i (which are infamous for their bad quality). In addition, there was an animated series that ran for thirteen episodes in <a href=\"/north-america/3035-1664/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1664\">North America</a>. The Legend of Zelda has also had various manga adaptions, but none of them have been produced in North America.</p><h2>Games</h2><h3>Nintendo Entertainment System</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4571/331461-zelda.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-331461\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.444\" data-width=\"250\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 250px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:144.4%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4571/331461-zelda.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-331461\"><img alt=\"The Legend of Zelda\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/4571/331461-zelda.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/4571/331461-zelda.png 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\"></a><figcaption>The Legend of Zelda</figcaption></figure><p>The Legend of Zelda franchise started in 1987 when <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda/3030-11949/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11949\">The Legend of Zelda</a> was released by Nintendo for the <a href=\"/nes/3055-2794/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2794\">Nintendo Entertainment System</a> (NES).

This game was a return to the gameplay of the original Legend of Zelda. This game expanded upon as well as refined the original in many ways. A Dark World was implemented, which Link could travel to and from. In this Dark World, everything in Hyrule was corrupted by Ganon's influence and monsters roamed the land, making Link's quest even more difficult. The iconic Pieces of Heart were introduced and scattered across Hyrule to spread out the rewards for exploration across the much larger game world. Pieces of Heart have been in every Legend of Zelda title since A Link to the Past.</p><p>A Link to the Past is widely recognized as one of the greatest games of all time, and is considered one of the high points of the series. A Japanese loose \"sequel\" was released on the <a href=\"/satellaview/3045-98/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-98\">Satellaview</a>, titled <a href=\"/bs-zelda-no-densetsu-kodai-no-sekiban/3030-22297/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-22297\">BS Zelda no Densetsu Kodai no Sekiban</a>.

In 1998, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time was released, and fans were treated to ground-breaking 3D graphics and a massive adventure previously unseen in a 3D environment.</p><p>Even though it looked like something totally new, the core gameplay was nearly identical to previous entries. The most notable addition was the eponymous <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/3030-12572/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12572\">Ocarina of Time</a> (which had been in A Link to the Past), which, when coupled with the Master Sword in the Temple of Time, allowed Link to travel in time a span of seven years, subsequently giving rise to Adult Link.</p><p>The Ocarina allowed the player to alter Hyrule in many ways (time of day, weather, etc.). <a href=\"/koji-kondo/3040-606/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-606\">Koji Kondo</a> (a longtime composer for Nintendo) had composed ten songs specifically to be played on the Ocarina.</p><p>An important innovation was the revolutionary \"Z-targeting\" system which allowed Link to lock on to a single target and focus on fighting him, dedicating sword swipes and enabling evasive maneuvering. This proved to be the way to control third-person action games in 3D; the system was simple and easy to get into, and every 3D Legend of Zelda game since has contained the Z-targeting system.</p><p>Ocarina of Time is often considered to be the greatest game in the series, and places among the greatest of all time. It received the \"Game of the Year\" award from the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences, the only Japanese game to do so. IGN, Famitsu, GameSpot, and Edge Magazine awarded their first perfect scores to Ocarina. <a href=\"/jeff-gerstmann/3040-89712/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-89712\">Jeff Gerstmann</a> stated that Ocarina \"can't be called anything other than flawless.\" Nintendo Power considered it to be the second greatest games to appear on a Nintendo console, behind <a href=\"/super-mario-bros/3030-15544/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15544\">Super Mario Bros.</a> and surpassing <a href=\"/super-mario-galaxy/3030-16094/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16094\">Super Mario Galaxy</a>.

This time the trailer was <a href=\"/cel-shading/3015-173/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-173\">cel-shaded</a> and stylized.

This was one of the few games to not have Princess Zelda, the Triforce, or Ganon in it. Link's Awakening was later released on the <a href=\"/game-boy-color/3045-57/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-57\">Game Boy Color</a> as an enhanced version titled <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda-links-awakening-dx/3030-8881/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8881\">The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX</a>, which, aside from being in full-color, included an extra dungeon that relied specifically on the use of color.</p><p>The next two Legend of Zelda handheld games were released simultaneously for the Game Boy Color. <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda-oracle-of-ages/3030-8004/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8004\">The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages</a> and <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda-oracle-of-seasons/3030-5895/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5895\">The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons</a> and were both released in 2001. They were built to interact uniquely by passwords, making it so that in the respective game the player could unlock the true ending.</p><p>It is notable that these two games were developed by Capcom's in-house development team, <a href=\"/flagship-studios/3010-3290/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-3290\">Flagship</a>. Originally, there were going to be three games, but the password system proved to be too complex, so they scrapped the third title. Oracle of Ages is the more puzzle-oriented of the two, while Oracle of Seasons is more action-based (although Oracle of Ages is generally considered the better of the two).</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4340/450608-920670_front.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-450608\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.99375\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:99.4%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4340/450608-920670_front.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-450608\"><img alt=\"The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4340/450608-920670_front.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/4340/450608-920670_front.jpg 640w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4340/450608-920670_front.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4340/450608-920670_front.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4340/450608-920670_front.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/4340/450608-920670_front.jpg 640w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4340/450608-920670_front.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4340/450608-920670_front.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap</figcaption></figure><p>In 2005, <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda-the-minish-cap/3030-6145/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6145\">The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap</a> was released.

Philips and Nintendo had a deal to create a CD peripheral for the SNES, and as part of the deal, Nintendo gave Philips access to their first-party titles. When the deal fell apart, Philips still had these licenses, and so they created several CD-i games based on Nintendo's franchises.

Link is a starting character, while extra characters like Zelda, Ganon, and a younger version of Link are available for unlocking as the player progresses through the game.</p><h2>The Legend of Zelda in Other Media</h2><h3>The Legend of Zelda TV Show</h3><p>The Legend of Zelda was a TV show loosely based off of the games (more specifically, the first two games on the NES). The TV show was produced by DiC Entertainment and ran for thirteen episodes on Fox through September 8, 1989 and December 1, 1989. The show was not very well-received, with IGN giving the DVD release of the show a three, citing poor acting and dialogue, and general repetitiveness. This bad quality is come to be somewhat of a joke among fans, especially Link's catchphrase in the show, \"Excuuuuuuse me, princess,\" which he repeats 49 times during the thirteen episodes.</p><p>The show's premise involved Link and Princess Zelda defending the Triforce of Wisdom from the evil wizard Ganon. Each episode is some evil plot that Ganon has cooked up to try and capture the Triforce (for the ultimate goal of conquering all of Hyrule). Other minor characters included a fairy named Sprite and the king (Zelda's father). Throughout the series, there is a minor sub-plot of Link trying to get a kiss from Zelda, and always failing (usually because the two are interrupted). Several other characters and enemies from the game appear, including Moblins, Octoroks, Gohma, Aquamentus, Keese, and Ropes. In addition, weapons from the game make appearances, including boomerangs, bows, and Link's sword and shield.</p><h3>Episodes</h3><ol><li><b>The Ringer</b> (September 8, 1989)</li><li><b>Cold Spells</b> (September 15, 1989)</li><li><b>The White Knight</b> (September 22, 1989)</li><li><b>Kiss 'n' Tell</b> (September 29, 1989)</li><li><b>Sing for the Unicorn</b> (October 6, 1989)</li><li><b>That Sinking Feeling</b> (October 13, 1989)</li><li><b>Doppelganger</b> (October 20, 1989)</li><li><b>Underworld Connections</b> (October 27, 1989)</li><li><b>Stinging a Stinger</b> (November 3, 1989)</li><li><b>A Hitch in the Works</b> (November 10, 1989)</li><li><b>Fairies in the Spring</b> (November 17, 1989)</li><li><b>The Missing Link</b> (November 24, 1989)</li><li><b>The Moblins Are Revolting</b> (December 1, 1989)</li></ol><h3>Manga and Comics</h3><p>The Legend of Zelda has had a considerable amount of manga and comic books. Games that have had manga adaptations include The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages/Seasons, The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures, The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap, The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass, and The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker. Of note in these adaptations are a possible origin for the Majora's Mask, a plot revealing <a href=\"/agahnim/3005-2342/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2342\">Agahnim</a> (from A Link to the Past) as a friend of Link's father, but otherwise the manga adaptations generally followed the plot of the games.</p><p>In North America, Valiant Comics did a comic book adaptation of the series. The comic series expanded the land of Hyrule, and didn't cover a specific game. The comic ran for two volumes with five issues in each volume. The comic book introduced one character (Captain Krin), and named a previously unnamed character (King Harkinian, named in The Wind Waker as <a href=\"/king-daphnes-nohansen-hyrule/3005-3600/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3600\">King Daphnes Nohansen Hyrule</a>, but known as merely the King of Hyrule in other games).</p><h2>Trivia</h2><ul><li>The Wii version of Twilight Princess was a mirror of the GameCube version.

The biggest gameplay addition this game made was the ability to walk. Walking can be used to get to areas easier, or used in combos. Goal, deck, and trick creation modes were also added.

In this game\u2019s story, you play as a skater that moves to Los Angeles and helps rebuild a skate park. This was the first game in the Tony Hawk series to feature an open world and the first and only in the series to feature online play in the <a href=\"/xbox/3045-32/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-32\">Xbox</a> release.

The Nintendo DS release of American Sk8land has additional features such as customization modes, touch-screen controls, and downloadable missions, but lacks several other features such as the ability to get off the board and the ability to ride BMX bikes. The story is slightly different as well.

In this game\u2019s story, the player's created character tries to become the number one skater on Tony Hawk\u2019s new team, Project 8. The biggest change to the gameplay was the Nail-the-Trick mode, which allows players to control the skateboard\u2019s rotation with the analog sticks.

This game tried to reinvigorate the franchise by giving players different ways to play by dividing the game\u2019s goals into three categories, rigger, pro, and hardcore. Rigger goals have the player modifying the game\u2019s world to complete goals, such as building a ramp so you can jump over a car. Professional goals have players doing things such as competing in completions and taking photos. Hardcore goals focus mostly on skating. Nail-the-Trick has been expanded upon in this game with Nail-the-Grab and Nail-the Manual. Other new tricks include the agro kick, bowl skating moves, and the ability to skate check NPCs.</p><h2>Robomodo Era</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1619/1030320-tony_hawk_ride_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1030320\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.45685279187817\" data-width=\"591\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 591px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:45.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1619/1030320-tony_hawk_ride_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1030320\"><img alt=\"The skateboard peripheral used for Tony Hawk: Ride and Tony Hawk: Shred.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/1619/1030320-tony_hawk_ride_2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/1619/1030320-tony_hawk_ride_2.jpg 591w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/1619/1030320-tony_hawk_ride_2.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/1619/1030320-tony_hawk_ride_2.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The skateboard peripheral used for Tony Hawk: Ride and Tony Hawk: Shred.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/1619/1030320-tony_hawk_ride_2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/1619/1030320-tony_hawk_ride_2.jpg 591w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/1619/1030320-tony_hawk_ride_2.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/1619/1030320-tony_hawk_ride_2.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The skateboard peripheral used for Tony Hawk: Ride and Tony Hawk: Shred.</figcaption></figure><p>In 2008, <a href=\"/tony-hawks-motion-and-hue-pixel-painter/3030-23634/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-23634\">Tony Hawk\u2019s Motion and Hue Pixel Painter</a> was released for the Nintendo DS.

Starring in Alex Kidd in Miracle World the character never did rival Nintendo's mascot despite starring in several games of reasonable critical acclaim. Whilst Mario went on to largely embody gaming and the mass market appeal it's capable of, Alex Kidd starred in his final game in 1990 and was \"replaced\" by the more success Sonic as Sega's mascot.</p><h2>Characteristics</h2><p>At his core the Alex Kidd character holds a very simple set of characteristics. A brave orphan of hidden royal lineage his key skill is Shellcore, namely the ability to enlarge his fists and punch with incredible strength. He is also a skilled practitioner of \"Janken\", a paper scissors stone game played to the death in the Alex Kidd universe. He can also ride a motorbike and a fly a peddle helicopter. His age varies from 14 to hundreds of years old depending on which game you play and his clothes also vary from game to game. Indeed it's hard to come to any consensus on what constitutes the characteristics of an Alex Kidd game as they also varied greatly from title to title.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>Sega were late to the 8-bit era and by the time they looked to launch the Master System in the west Nintendo were well entrenched. Super Mario Bros was going beyond a video game and becoming a pop culture success and the NES was selling well. Sega's mascot at the time was \"Opa Opa\" and was not deemed to be a good fit for the western market. As such Alex Kidd became an unofficial leader for Sega in the west. The obvious parallels in Alex Kidd's look and the games genre seemed to make him an ideal fit. Alex Kidd in Miracle World was launched on cartridge and became a pack in for the Master System several years later. The game did not achieve the commercial success of Super Mario Bros but was a stand out title for the console with innovative gameplay.</p><h2>Downfall</h2><p>Following this Alex Kidd rapidly lost critical acclaim which was in reality the only thing it held at this point. Alex Kidd and the Lost Stars launched in arcades the same year as Miracle World but didn't have the same gameplay style as the console game. A left to right platformer the game held all the hallmarks of a Mario clone. The console port in 1988 also held little difficulty or replay value leaving gamers with a weak game which is easily beaten. The game also had the first redesign of the Alex Kidd character with a large head drawing focus to his monkey like ears. The next game to reach the west was Alex Kidd in High Tech World. A taller thinner Alex this time is in an adventure game where he seeks items and solves puzzles. Frequent changes to asthetic and gameplay continued to damage the brand and by this point sales ensured Alex Kidd was no more than a cult product for Sega fans.</p><p>Alex Kidd and the Enchanted Castle saw a return to the Miracle World style of game, Janken included. Providing an early showcase of the power of the Genesis the bright platformer gave hope of a return to form for Alex Kidd. However the game suffered from poor controls and whilst the return of Janken seemed like a good idea it's expansion highlighted the luck aspect of paper scissors stone. With no gameplay gimmick to get around this it was easy to lose lives frequently through Janken matches. Again the game drew criticisms of being too short with there being less levels than Miracle World despite being on the larger Genesis cartridge. The final title in the series highlights the levels to which Alex Kidd reached. Alex Kidd in Shinobi world was a $30, 4 level parody of Shinobi released on the Master System in 1990.</p>", "guid": "3025-24", "name": "Alex Kidd"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-25", "name": "Alien"}, {"description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Aliens vs. Predator has spawned a multitude of video games based off of the popular movie and comic book franchise.

While this game is a beat-em-up game akin to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, it differs in several ways. Naturally, the game plays different due to the large gap in controls. One of the largest differences is the fact that the arcade version allows players to control one of two different Predators, rather than being constrained to one Predator.</p><h3>Alien vs. Predator (Jaguar)</h3><p>This 1994 <a href=\"/alien-vs-predator/3030-8142/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8142\"> Jaguar game</a> is among the most well-known and well-received games that <a href=\"/atari/3010-634/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-634\"> Atari</a> published on the platform. The game is a first person shooter, and the first in the franchise to offer the option to play as the alien and humans. Playing as the Predator, the objective is to kill the alien queen, the alien must rescue the alien queen, and the human (Private Lewis) must merely escape the military base without being killed by the aliens or Predators.</p><h3>Aliens versus Predator (PC)</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9560/375376-180px_avp_m02_ayool.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-375376\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9560/375376-180px_avp_m02_ayool.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-375376\"><img alt=\" This 1999 was well-received for its engaging gameplay.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/9560/375376-180px_avp_m02_ayool.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/9560/375376-180px_avp_m02_ayool.jpg 640w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/9560/375376-180px_avp_m02_ayool.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/9560/375376-180px_avp_m02_ayool.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\" This 1999 was well-received for its engaging gameplay.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/9560/375376-180px_avp_m02_ayool.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/9560/375376-180px_avp_m02_ayool.jpg 640w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/9560/375376-180px_avp_m02_ayool.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/9560/375376-180px_avp_m02_ayool.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption> This 1999 was well-received for its engaging gameplay.</figcaption></figure><p> </p><p>Just like the standard set with the Jaguar game, 1999's <a href=\"/aliens-versus-predator/3030-7140/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7140\"> Aliens versus Predator</a> has three separate campaigns to play through. The game is also a first person shooter, and was very well-received by critics (just like the Jaguar game). The three stories offered are an unnamed Colonial Marine (whose objective is to fight his way through a research station, and eventually kill the alien queen), an alien (whose primary goal is to reach the <i>Ferarco</i>, a marine ship, and destroy it), and a Predator (who visits several different planets in order to recapture a Predator ship, fight off Alien/Predator hybrids, and kill the alien queen).</p><h3>Aliens versus Predator 2 (PC)</h3><p>The sequel to the 1999 PC game, <a href=\"/aliens-versus-predator-2/3030-1503/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1503\"> Aliens versus Predator 2</a> continues the trend of allowing for three different campaigns.

Primal Hunt was received very poorly compared to the first two games, receiving scores ranging from 50% to 60% from publications such as GameSpot and IGN.

The game was deemed mediocre by critics, averaging a 65% on Game Rankings. Extinction is unlike traditional real time strategy games in that it doesn't have players build up their bases. Rather, the game is entirely focused on producing units and fighting with said units. All three factions are represented in Extinction, with each having unique units and abilities.</p><h3>Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (PSP)</h3><p>Released on November 13, 2007, Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem is based off of the film of the same name. Requiem is a third-person action-adventure game, and the lowest rated game in the franchise. The game stars the Predator in 15 different missions, utilizing stealth and a variety of weapons to dispatch aliens. A new feature added into the game was the requirement to remove all traces of the Predator, including the dead bodies of murdered aliens and humans.</p><h3>Aliens vs. Predator (PC, PS3, 360)</h3><p>The most recent game released in the franchise, Aliens vs. Predator debuted on February 16, 2010. The game has received mixed reviews from critics, with a 67% on Metacritic and a 64% on Game Rankings. Returning to the style of the Aliens versus Predator games on PC, this game once again contains three separate campaigns (alien, Predator, and humans). Aliens vs. Predator places a much higher focus on the multiplayer aspect of the game, with many multiplayer modes and game types.</p><h2>Canceled Games</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1296480-aliens_vs_predator18.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1296480\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"200\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1296480-aliens_vs_predator18.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1296480\"><img alt=\" The canceled Lynx version was intended to be a port of the Jaguar game.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/1296480-aliens_vs_predator18.gif\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/1296480-aliens_vs_predator18.gif 200w\"><noscript><img alt=\" The canceled Lynx version was intended to be a port of the Jaguar game.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/1296480-aliens_vs_predator18.gif\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/1296480-aliens_vs_predator18.gif 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\"></noscript></a><figcaption> The canceled Lynx version was intended to be a port of the Jaguar game.</figcaption></figure><p>Two Aliens vs. Predator games have been canceled since their announcement.

Where the original was more focused on character interaction with the environment, the second was much more action-based. Focusing on firearms and gun battles with enemies. This game was also ported to the 3DO, by Interplay, in 1995.</p><h2>Alone in the Dark 3</h2><p>The final game in the Alone in the Dark trilogy was <a href=\"/alone-in-the-dark-3/3030-7535/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7535\">Alone in the Dark 3</a> and the very last to utilize the same engine and characters as the original two.

Released in 2001 for the PlayStation and Dreamcast by Darkworks, and for the PC and Playstation 2 by Spiral Studios. An alternative GameBoy Color version was developed and released by Pocket Studios. The game resembles the Resident Evil series in control scheme and gameplay.

The game immediately stood out for its open-world feel and the lack of conventional video game tropes such as points, combat or levels. In Animal Crossing you take control of an unnamed character in a village populated by various kinds of animals. Essentially Animal Crossing is open-ended in that there is no main objective, although the game features various challenges that evolve as time progresses. The game also runs in <a data-ref-id=\"3015-4394\" href=\"/real-time-waiting/3015-4394/\" slug=\"real-time-waiting\">real-time</a>, meaning that time is continually passing and allowing it to recognize important events such as <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3967\" href=\"/halloween/3015-3967/\" slug=\"halloween\">Halloween</a> or New Year.</p><h2>Main Goal</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/20294/1308728-animal_crossing___home.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1308728\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/20294/1308728-animal_crossing___home.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1308728\"><img alt=\"Your house after you've fully upgraded it.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/20294/1308728-animal_crossing___home.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/2/20294/1308728-animal_crossing___home.jpg 1024w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/2/20294/1308728-animal_crossing___home.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/2/20294/1308728-animal_crossing___home.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/20294/1308728-animal_crossing___home.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Your house after you've fully upgraded it.</figcaption></figure><p>While there really is no main objective to the game, when starting out, you're asked to complete a few simple tasks before you're let out on your own. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-366\" href=\"/tom-nook/3005-366/\" slug=\"tom-nook\">Tom Nook</a> will first approach you and try to sell you a house. After you choose which one to assimilate into, he'll ask for an exorbitant amount and will be disappointed that you only have 1,000 bells. (Bells are a form of currency in Animal Crossing) He'll then offer you to work of the rest of the wages and you'll be asked to do tasks such as delivering mail or items, meeting new people, and even planting trees outside his store.</p><p>After you finish paying off Tom Nook for your first mortgage, you're free to do as you please. From here on out, you can pay off more mortgages to increase the size of your house, purchase new furniture to spruce up your place, interact with other citizens of your town, and even attend local events such as 4th of July or New Year's.</p><h2>Activities</h2><p>Although Animal Crossing has no end goal the game keeps the player occupied by providing a number of activites to immerse themselves in. Perhaps the player's primary occupation is home improvement: when starting out in Animal Crossing the player has a sparsly decorated one-level house which they are tasked with improving. Everything from the color of the roof to the carpet can be customized, and the house will be the recepticle for the many and various objects the player will collect. There is an aspect of challenge in this area of the game as the player's house is assessed every Sunday by the Happy Room Academy.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2787/218306-2ndfloor.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-218306\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2787/218306-2ndfloor.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-218306\"><img alt=\"To get the most HRA points, buy your furniture in sets and decorate the whole room in it.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/2787/218306-2ndfloor.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/2787/218306-2ndfloor.jpg 640w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/2787/218306-2ndfloor.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"To get the most HRA points, buy your furniture in sets and decorate the whole room in it.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/2787/218306-2ndfloor.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/2787/218306-2ndfloor.jpg 640w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/2787/218306-2ndfloor.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>To get the most HRA points, buy your furniture in sets and decorate the whole room in it.</figcaption></figure><p>Even after you finish paying off Tom Nook, there are still a wide variety of things to do. Time in Animal Crossing progresses much like the real world. If you're gone for a long time, your friends and acquaintances will move away or wonder where you've been. Cockroaches will start running around your house and the only way to get rid of them is to run over them. There are thousands of ways to customize your house and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feng_shui\" rel=\"nofollow \">Feng Shui</a> it in order to give it a certain vibe. The Happy Room Academy (HRA) will look at your house and send you a letter detailing how well they think you've done with your house and will allocate points to you based on if you set up certain rooms in sets. They do not, however, judge your basement, as that serves mainly for storage and miscellaneous belongings.</p><p>Tom Nook's store has a wide variety of items to purchase, and you can even sell your belongings for some extra cash if you desperately need it. He'll even offer you a catalog to purchase items from if you've already owned them, and he'll send them to you the very next day. There is a certain limit on how many items you can pre-order, but you can always come back the next day and order some more items.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5891/261317-animalcrossgc_002_large.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-261317\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.79452054794521\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:79.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5891/261317-animalcrossgc_002_large.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-261317\"><img alt=\"You can watch the fireworks on the 4th of July with friends.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 438px) 100vw, 438px\" data-width=\"438\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/5891/261317-animalcrossgc_002_large.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/5891/261317-animalcrossgc_002_large.jpg 438w\"><noscript><img alt=\"You can watch the fireworks on the 4th of July with friends.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/5891/261317-animalcrossgc_002_large.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/5891/261317-animalcrossgc_002_large.jpg 438w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 438px) 100vw, 438px\" data-width=\"438\"></noscript></a><figcaption>You can watch the fireworks on the 4th of July with friends.</figcaption></figure><p>Around town, there are always events during the holiday's to keep oneself occupied.

If you are wearing some nice, suitable clothing, he'll offer you a nice gift for yourself or your house. During Halloween, your friends will dress up and go Trick or Treating. During the 4th of July, you can find all of the villagers in your town gathered around the local pond to watch the fireworks, and you'll even see a concession stand in which you can purchase props and other event related materials.</p><p>A bulletin board in the middle of town allows you to read up on the latest events and findings in the town. Whether someone buried something in a certain acre for you to find, or an aerobic class is starting up at 9 A.M. on Saturday, Animal Crossing offers multiple activities for your character to participate in. Every Saturday, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-367\" href=\"/kk-slider/3005-367/\" slug=\"kk-slider\">K.K. Slider</a> will show up and play you a few songs on his guitar.

You can usually find furniture (which come in the form of leaves and eventually sprout in your house), you can also find fossils that you can send to the local museum and donate prehistoric bones and such. Oddly enough, you can find shirts to wear or take to the local tailor and have it modified.</p><p>You're also able to create designs to put on your door or take the to tailor and have it placed on a shirt. You can go to the local post office and send letters to family and friends or withdraw and deposit cash. Next to the post office is a little bulletin board that you can adjust to play a certain tune. This tune can then be heard among the town whenever talking to people or when entering Tom Nook's Store. Different iterations will be played for different people. For example, when talking to a cheery person, you'll get a soft, upbeat melody. When talking to a more pessimistic character, you'll be greeted with a dark, ominous interpretation of your song.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5891/261308-animal_crossing_screen.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-261308\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.72\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:72.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5891/261308-animal_crossing_screen.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-261308\"><img alt=\"You can find a lot of rare fish in the water.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/5891/261308-animal_crossing_screen.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/5891/261308-animal_crossing_screen.jpg 500w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/5891/261308-animal_crossing_screen.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"You can find a lot of rare fish in the water.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/5891/261308-animal_crossing_screen.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/5891/261308-animal_crossing_screen.jpg 500w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/5891/261308-animal_crossing_screen.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>You can find a lot of rare fish in the water.</figcaption></figure><p>Fishing is also quite popular, and anything you catch can then be donated to the local museum and put up on display.

While the cutscenes and voice over stayed consistent and original, the biggest downfall was the gameplay and graphics, which hardly changed over the years. The newer games (mostly for the consoles) seemed to recycle the same game engine and graphics from previous titles with very little improvements. This made them looked outdated in newer consoles.</p><p>It is speculated that the reason behind the downfall is because of its rushed development. Between 1999 and 2002, over 19 titles were released every few months, meaning that they were being developed concurrently and released around the same time. This lead us to believe that 3DO were trying so hard to publish as many games as possible that they put little time and effort in each title.</p><p>Other criticisms include punishing difficulty and confusing timeline between each game. <a data-ref-id=\"3030-2070\" href=\"/army-men-rts/3030-2070/\" slug=\"army-men-rts\">Army Men RTS</a> was the last Army Men game to be released by 3DO before they filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The major franchises were auctioned off, and Army Men was purchased by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-168\" href=\"/global-star-software-inc/3010-168/\" slug=\"global-star-software-inc\">Global Star Software</a> (Now 2K Play).</p><p>With some original members joining Global Star, they released <a data-ref-id=\"3030-15642\" href=\"/army-men-sarges-war/3030-15642/\" slug=\"army-men-sarges-war\">Sarge's War</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-21274\" href=\"/army-men-major-malfunction/3030-21274/\" slug=\"army-men-major-malfunction\">Major Malfunction</a> but even with a fresh start, these games were criticized for being poor in every aspect. In 2008, <a data-ref-id=\"3010-4310\" href=\"/big-blue-bubble-inc/3010-4310/\" slug=\"big-blue-bubble-inc\">Big Blue Bubble</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3010-362\" href=\"/zoo-digital-publishing-ltd/3010-362/\" slug=\"zoo-digital-publishing-ltd\">ZOO Digital Publishing</a> released <a data-ref-id=\"3030-21026\" href=\"/army-men-soldiers-of-misfortune/3030-21026/\" slug=\"army-men-soldiers-of-misfortune\">Army Men: Soldiers of Misfortune</a>, which looked nothing like the original series because of its child-like characters and settings.</p><h2>Number of Releases by Year</h2><p><b>1998:</b> 1</p><p><b>1999:</b> 7</p><p><b>2000:</b> 3</p><p><b>2001:</b> 5</p><p><b>2002:</b> 4</p><p><b>2003:</b> 1</p><p><b>2004:</b> 1</p><p><b>2006:</b> 1</p><p><b>2008:</b> 1</p>", "guid": "3025-36", "name": "Army Men"}, {"description": "<p><b>The Trilogy</b></p><p>Art of Fighting (originally Ryuuko no Ken) was another venture by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-616\" href=\"/snk-playmore/3010-616/\">SNK</a> in <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1427\" href=\"/2d/3015-1427/\">2D fighting</a> released in 1992.

The protagonist, <a href=\"/bayek/3005-36075/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-36075\">Bayek</a>, sets out to uncover a conspiracy involving the Order of the Ancients and their ties to the political factions seeking control of Egypt.</p><p>Origins represented a significant change to the series formula, featuring the entirety of Egypt as an open world to be explored. The game does not have a minimap, opting instead of a simple compass that indicates nearby points of interest. The combat was redesigned for Origins. Players have a shield to block attacks and arrows, a bow to engage enemies at range, a large variety of swords, axes, and hammers to wield. The combat uses a hitbox system similar to <a href=\"/dark-souls/3030-32697/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-32697\">Dark Souls</a>, rather than the combo/counter focused combat of previous games.</p><h3><a href=\"/assassins-creed-odyssey/3030-68771/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-68771\">Assassin's Creed Odyssey</a></h3><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC</p><p><strong>Released: </strong>October 5, 2018</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3699/3028052-assassins%20creed%20-%20odyssey%20v3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3028052\" data-ratio=\"1.25\" data-width=\"1200\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:125.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3699/3028052-assassins%20creed%20-%20odyssey%20v3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3028052\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" data-width=\"512\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/3699/3028052-assassins%20creed%20-%20odyssey%20v3.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/3699/3028052-assassins%20creed%20-%20odyssey%20v3.jpg 1200w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/3699/3028052-assassins%20creed%20-%20odyssey%20v3.jpg 768w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/3699/3028052-assassins%20creed%20-%20odyssey%20v3.jpg 512w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/3699/3028052-assassins%20creed%20-%20odyssey%20v3.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/3699/3028052-assassins%20creed%20-%20odyssey%20v3.jpg 1200w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/3699/3028052-assassins%20creed%20-%20odyssey%20v3.jpg 768w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/3699/3028052-assassins%20creed%20-%20odyssey%20v3.jpg 512w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" data-width=\"512\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Set in <a href=\"/greece/3035-243/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-243\">Classical Greece</a> during the Peloponessian War in 431 BCE, Assassin's Creed Odyssey features a choice between a male or <a href=\"/kassandra/3005-37150/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-37150\">female</a> protagonist.

Battlefield 2 takes place in the early 21st century using a fictional world war as a back drop. The game allies the United States with the European Union against China and a fictional Middle Eastern Coalition. The game's story places the US and the EU as allies, the EU having struck a peace treaty with Russia. It is unknown but suspected that China and the Middle Eastern Coalition are allies. Battlefield 2 takes place in many different fronts of battle as the US and EU forces invade MEC and Chinese territory and the Chinese and MEC armies invading the US and EU territories . Battlefield 2 contains fifteen maps ranging from swamplands to urban settings. Each map in Battlefield 2 also has three variations, each tailored to a certain number of players 16, 32 or 64.</p><p>Battlefield 2 features many features to make the large scale battles more manageable such as squads consisting of six players whom can communicate through an in game VoIP system, as well as each squad having a squad leader whom can communicate directly with the overall battle commander and request support such as artillery.</p><p>Each team is given a commander, generally selected from the higher ranked members of the team. These commanders have access to a special 'Commander Screen' which serves as an interface for them to interact with individual squads and use their commander assets to send artillery strikes to a hot zone, drop in vehicles or supplies and call in UAV support. Commanders can resign, allowing another player to take up the roll, or if the need arises be voted out of the position by the members of their team.</p><p>Battlefield 2 was released to much critical acclaim, but had a fair share of negative reviews mostly due to the multitude of bugs and glitches which made it through to the retail release. Currently the game has been patched to version 1.5, and while some bugs still remain, most game breaking bugs have been fixed.</p><ul><li><a href=\"/battlefield-2-special-forces/3030-13029/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13029\">Battlefield 2: Special Forces</a> - The first and only expansion pack for Battlefield 2 was released in November of 2005.

In Titan mode the objective is to destroy the opposing teams Titan while defending your own from destruction. Titans are huge flying warships with force fields surrounding and protecting them from enemy saboteurs and normal weapons fire.

This game introduced the grappling mechanics that the series would become famous for, but it was otherwise a standard (and difficult) shooter. This version would come home for various machines, including the Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Amiga, and Atari ST. In a weird twist, there are actually two different ports of the arcade game available for the C64.</p><p>In 1988, Bionic Commando was released for the NES. This game is technically a sequel to the arcade game, going by the name of Top Secret: Hitler's Revival in Japan. This game ditches the simplicity of the arcade version for a more open-ended approach, where the player would visit areas multiple times, unlock equipment, and so on. At the end of the game, the player faces off against Adolf Hitler, though in the US version all mention of Nazis and of Hitler were replaced with less controversial names.</p><p>Four years later, Bionic Commando was released on the original Game Boy, and for the first time the Bionic Commando name was used worldwide, marking the end of the Top Secret line. The Game Boy version has many similarities to the NES game mechanically, but the story is new.</p><p>Bionic Commando would stay handheld with the 1999 release of Bionic Commando: Elite Forces, this time appearing on the Game Boy Color. Nintendo's US-based NST division developed this game under license from Capcom, perhaps signifying the popularity for the series in America. This game retained some of the same gameplay mechanics and style of the past two games, but had an all-new plot and additional moves.</p><p>After letting the series lie dormant for nearly a decade, Capcom once against revived the franchise. <a data-ref-id=\"3010-405\" href=\"/grin/3010-405/\" slug=\"grin\"> GRIN</a>, a Sweden-based developer who previously worked on PC ports of Ubisoft's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter games, developed Bionic Commando Rearmed. This was an updated remake of the NES game released as a downloadable title on PC, Xbox Live Arcade, and PlayStation Network in August 2008. The game featured a multiplayer component consisting of online competitive matches and local co-op play.</p><p>In 2009, the imaginatively-titled \"Bionic Commando\" brought the franchise to the next generation consoles, going from the side-scrolling sprites that every other game has used to a behind-the-back third-person camera. The title also featured connectivity with the downloadable Bionic Commando Rearmed remake game.</p><p>A sequel to Bionic Commando Rearmed was released in early February 2011, introducing the ability to jump for the first time and adding a mustache to the physical appearance of Spencer.</p><h2>Canon Timeline</h2><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>19XX AD - A former president is kidnapped by rebels while on a humanitarian mission in the country of Zutula.

That, and the fact that the game featured unique abilities and engaging combat, beings to explain why this under-the-radar release quickly became a sleeper hit. <a href=\"/bloodrayne-2/3030-1636/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1636\"> BloodRayne 2</a> attempted to capitalize on the first instalment with a frenzied publicity campaign that put the cult hit in the spotlight. From music videos to a nude spread in Playboy, little was left to the imagination. The sequel met with mediocre reviews and comparable sales, but, for a while, the stage seemed set for a third installment. Things soon took a turn for the worst as BloodRayne for the PSP was canceled and the game's publisher <a href=\"/majesco-entertainment/3010-370/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-370\"> Majesco </a>announced that they were turning to the casual market in hopes of saving their ailing company.

Also the player was able to utilize supernatural abilities to solve puzzles and slaughter the Nazi menace. The main ability which set the game apart was being able drink the blood of your enemies. Instead of health packs BloodRayne allowed the player to drain the enemies to restore her health. This played a vital role in the gameplay and added more sexually suggestive moments than one can count. The sequel retained many of these same gameplay features, but dropped the Nazi angle and moved the action to the present day - as a dhampir, Rayne appears to be ageless, looking much the same in the early 2000's as she did in the 40's. BloodRayne 2 also presented a much more linear experience, rather than having the player backtrack throughout more massive levels. It also removed the ability to use enemy weapons and replaced the multitude of firearms from the first BloodRayne with a single gun that used blood as ammo, thereby increasing the need to feed. As the player moved through the game, the gun increased in power and could change from a machine gun to a rocket launcher, but still didn't bring the amount of combat options seen in the first installment. Instead, variety was provided by BloodRayne's blades\u2014which could slice and dice (and possibly even mince) enemies very quickly\u2014as well as the occasional acrobatic challenge.</p><p> </p><h2>Movie</h2><p>Three BloodRayne movies have been released with awful quality, embarrassing sales, and critical and public ridicule. The movies bear little resemblance to the games and are reputed by viewers as possibly some of the worst movies ever made. The embarrassment of the movies have all but killed any possibility of a third game. Director Uwe Boll has released several other movies based on games, each failing on all possible levels. Controversy and fanboy outcries against the director have gone unheard by the owners of the game's I.P.</p><p> </p><h2>Trivia</h2><p>The character BloodRayne appeared nude in Playboy as a promotion for BloodRayne 2. She also appeared in a music video for the rock band for Evanescence and had a short-lived comic book series. Her last appearance in 3D form was in the PSP game <a href=\"/infected/3030-2988/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2988\"> Infected</a>.</p>", "guid": "3025-64", "name": "BloodRayne"}, {"description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>An arcade concept originally titled Beastorizer by Hudson Soft, incorporated a concept of rapidly changing fighting conditions, as each character (classified as Zoanthropes) could transform almost at will into an Anthropomorphic alter-ego, complete with their own moves and special abilities.</p><h2>Critical Reception</h2><p>The series meets with mixed reactions by both the consumers and critics, while fairly received by those who play it, often gets critisized for its shallow combat system and basic-as-it-gets arenas, but the Beastmode concept is a highly enjoyable and memorable experience, and the combat (while shallow) remains fun.</p><h2>Future Installments</h2><p>No future Bloody Roar entries are currently planned. A hoax was propagated by a fake English twitter account on September 30, 2011 that a Bloody Roar 5 was in production.</p>", "guid": "3025-65", "name": "Bloody Roar"}, {"description": "<h3>Story</h3><p>Sometime in the future, the natural cycle of life and death has been broken. The undead rise and four powerful demons known as Immortals take up residence in Istrakan. San Miguel, the City of the Sun, has become a place of darkness. The world's most powerful vampire hunter has fallen, and it's up to his son Django, the heir to the Gun del Sol (a solar gun) to finish his father's work. He is accompanied by Master Otenko, a spritely sunflower who gives him advice at special hint panels.</p><p> </p><h3>Gameplay</h3><p>Boktai's core game design could be described as a 1:1 mixture of <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda/3025-9/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-9\"> Zelda</a> and <a href=\"/metal-gear-solid/3025-1575/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1575\"> Metal Gear Solid</a>. It takes place from an isometric perspective, giving the player an overview of the surrounding environment. Pressing and holding the R button allows you to look beyond the immediate screen to see if there are enemies in your vicinity. Similar to Solid Snake, Django must use stealth to infiltrate an area, and he has the ability to flatten up against walls and tap them to attract an enemy's attention. Different enemies react to sounds in different ways; Mummies (for example) are very fast and will quickly hone in on a sound's position, but are otherwise completely blind. Undead zombies can be tricked like typical Metal Gear grunts. Django can run, and shoot enemies using the Gun del Sol, which relies on solar-powered batteries for ammunition.</p><p> </p><p>The game's areas are presented in a map screen, broken up into small dungeon-like levels in between larger boss dungeons. These are timed and scored similar to Metal Gear, in that you will lose points if you are spotted by an enemy and if you take too long. There are also trap rooms that are somewhat similar to the <a href=\"/metal-gear-solid-vr-missions/3030-8761/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8761\"> VR Missions</a>. Dungeons are crawling with enemies and puzzles block the path (such as traditional block-pushing puzzles). A variety of elemental puzzles (ice and lava) also pose unique challenges.</p><p> </p><h3>Solar Sensor</h3><p>Unique to the Boktai series is the built-in solar sensor, which is used throughout the game for a variety of purposes. To begin with, the game asks you to enter your specific time and time zone. The game uses this information to sync with the real world, so it knows if you are playing during daylight hours. This is significant because Django's gun can only be recharged by standing in direct sunlight and holding up his gun, and enemies are generally weaker or in hiding. How quickly your gun charges depends entirely on the amount of sunlight registered by the sensor. A mid-to-low range is best, as too much sunlight will cause the gun to overheat (<i>this is likely to prevent you from getting sun stroke!</i>). Even when you're deep inside a crypt, there may be skylights that allow sunlight to trickle in which can be used mid-dungeon. Bosses in particular cannot be killed until day time (more on bosses below).</p><p> </p><p>At night, Django can charge his gun if he uses a solar station, though its power may be limited or costly. Small fireflies (only visible at night) appear which will also slightly refill your solar batteries. Enemies such as the undead become active and begin prowling the corridors, so the game becomes more difficult at night, but it is still possible to get most things done with the exception of eliminating bosses.</p><p> </p><h3>Bosses</h3><p>The bosses are similar to those in Metal Gear or Zelda, requiring quick pattern recognition skills and unique strategies. True to their name, the Immortals are only weakened after the fight, and become trapped in a coffin. The coffin must then be physically dragged out of the Immortal's lair and into the light of day where the Immortal can actually be killed. If the coffin is left alone, the Immortal inside will rustle inside the coffin, nudging themselves away while attracting the attention of enemies which will drag it back to their resting place. Although dragging the coffin outside may sound like a chore, the level designers have kept this in mind so that on your way out there are often short cuts.</p><p> </p><p>Once outside, Django places the coffin the center of the Solar Piledriver. This is a series of mirrors which flip up and focus the sun's rays directly at the coffin. Once the process begins, the Immortal's demonic soul pops out of the coffin and fights back, attempting to flip the mirrors away. Django must dodge their projectile attacks and keep the Solar Piledriver charged up and focused on the Immortal, and eventually the Immortal will die - permanently.</p><h3>Items &amp; Equipment</h3><p> </p><p>You'll find perishable items such as apples which can restore your health or power up your gun's solar batteries. There are also items like solar flares which cause the sunlight meter to fill up regardless of the time of day.</p><p> </p><p>The Gun del Sol is a complex piece of equipment with a variety of customizable pieces. Lenses focus the light into a shot or spread. The bigger the lens, the more powerful the attack. Extra battery tanks allow you to store more solar energy, which means you won't have to recharge as often. Grenades (L button) provide secondary fire. And the gun frame itself can change the type of attack; converting into elemental-type attacks (fire, earth, ice).</p><p> </p><h3>Multiplayer</h3><p>Boktai features a multiplayer death-match mode for 2-4 players (each player requires their own Boktai cartridge). Battles are timed, and the player with the most kills, the most coins collected, and the least deaths will be ranked on top. Players can also exchange items with one another.</p><p> </p><h3>Azure Sky Tower</h3><p> </p><p>Once the player has finished the game, they can visit the Azure Sky Tower, which is somewhat of a throwback to the PS1 Konami title <a href=\"/azure-dreams/3030-5846/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5846\"> Azure Dreams</a>. The player must climb the tower solving puzzles and killing enemies, until they reach a certain floor where they fight a knight. Killing the knight will unlock one of several emblems.</p><p> </p><h3>Sequels &amp; Criticism</h3><p> </p><p>Out of the four Boktai games, only Boktai 3 remained a Japanese exclusive. The 4th game moved the series onto the Nintendo DS, and was retitled Lunar Knights, though it lacked a solar sensor (and thus its functionality).</p><p> </p><p>Some players complained that the solar sensor related \"gimmicks\" were a burden at best and annoying at worst. For best results the game is best played outside. However, Boktai's bosses cannot be defeated at night, forcing players to adhere to a certain play schedule, and the game becomes almost unplayable during bad weather and in the winter in some areas due to the overcast skies. </p>", "guid": "3025-66", "name": "Boktai"}, {"description": "<br/>", "guid": "3025-67", "name": "Bomberman"}, {"description": "<h2>Overview</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4889/296564-bonk_bash.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-296564\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.704\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.4%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4889/296564-bonk_bash.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-296564\"><img alt=\"Bonk, the titular star of the franchise.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/4889/296564-bonk_bash.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/4889/296564-bonk_bash.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\"></a><figcaption>Bonk, the titular star of the franchise.</figcaption></figure><p>The Bonk franchise (known as PC Genjin in Japan and BC Kid in Europe) originated on the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-55\" href=\"/turbografx-16/3045-55/\" slug=\"turbografx-16\">TurboGrafx-16</a>, although the series' origins can be traced back even further. According to a <a data-ref-id=\"3010-419\" href=\"/hudson-entertainment-inc/3010-419/\" slug=\"hudson-entertainment-inc\">Hudson Soft</a> website, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3321\" href=\"/bonk/3005-3321/\" slug=\"bonk\">Bonk</a> was conceived as a comic book character and was featured in a Japanese magazine specializing on the PC Engine. Based on the popularity of the character, Hudson Soft decided to put Bonk into his own game (as the mascot of the TurboGrafx-16). Since <a data-ref-id=\"3030-6973\" href=\"/bonks-adventure/3030-6973/\" slug=\"bonks-adventure\">Bonk's Adventure</a>'s release in 1990, the franchise has seen scattered releases, with the latest being released across all major platforms later in 2010.</p><p>Bonk games have been relatively well-received, depending on the game. The first game was very well-received, garnering very positive reviews and great commercial success in Japan. Although the game did receive several awards outside of Japan (TurboGrafx-16 Game of the Year, Most Exciting New Theme of 1990, etc), the franchise has never performed exceptionally well in the United States.</p><h3>Naming Discrepancies</h3><p>Bonk's name in Japan is PC Genjin, which stands for \"Pithecanthropus Computerurus\" (and Genjin translates to Caveman). However, he has been referred to as FC Genjin (in the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-21\" href=\"/nes/3045-21/\" slug=\"nes\">Famicom</a> version, which carried the subtitle Freakthoropus Computerus or Friendthropus Computerurus), GB Genjin (in the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-3\" href=\"/game-boy/3045-3/\" slug=\"game-boy\">Game Boy</a> version), and even Chou Genjin (on the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-9\" href=\"/snes/3045-9/\" slug=\"snes\">Super Famicom</a> version). In addition, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-19338\" href=\"/air-zonk/3030-19338/\" slug=\"air-zonk\">Air Zonk</a> was initially known as PC Denjin (which carried the subtitle Punkic Cyborgs), which essentially means electric man.

The game stars the titular Bonk on a quest to rescue <a data-ref-id=\"3005-4557\" href=\"/princess-za/3005-4557/\" slug=\"princess-za\">Princess Za</a>, who is a smaller pink dinosaur. The princess has been captured by <a data-ref-id=\"3005-4177\" href=\"/king-drool/3005-4177/\" slug=\"king-drool\">King Drool</a>, a large dinosaur. Bonk's key attack is the ability to jump into the air and then smash down to the ground with his large head, smashing enemies and sometimes parts of the level. As Bonk collects meat, he can grow stronger and gain more special abilities. There are three levels of this; the first, normal level, the second level in which Bonk's ground pounds stun enemies, and the third level where Bonk is completely invincible for a short time.</p><p>Bonk's Adventure has been ported to a variety of platforms. The game's European version was ported to the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-1\" href=\"/amiga/3045-1/\" slug=\"amiga\">Commodore Amiga</a> by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-2695\" href=\"/factor-5-llc/3010-2695/\" slug=\"factor-5-llc\">Factor 5</a>, and has been since released for free on the company's website.

The game is very similar to Bonk's Adventure, gameplay wise. However, there were some major changes from the first game. Graphically, the game is much truer to the comic on which Bonk was originally based. The game also adds new characters and power-ups. Bonk has a much wider array of power-ups, from an item that freezes enemies to an item that causes Bonk to spin around wildly, killing everything he touches.</p><p>The plot of Bonk's Revenge concerns the theft of the moon by King Drool. Bonk must defeat King Drool and rescue Princess Za again, before he manages to create a kingdom of monsters. In Bonk's Revenge, there is a new arch-enemy of Bonk named Mechabonk, who is a robotic version of Bonk that constantly fights him in a one-on-one best out of three style match.</p><h3>Bonk 3: Bonk's Big Adventure</h3><p>The last of the trilogy of Bonk games for the TurboGrafx-16 was released in 1994 in two forms, as a cartridge and as a CD version. The game wasn't regarded as highly as the previous two games in the franchise, with many critics complaining that the gameplay was not changing enough. In addition, very few copies of the game were produced, due to the end of the TurboGrafx-16's lifespan, so the game goes for a good sum of money on auction sites nowadays. <a data-ref-id=\"3030-11312\" href=\"/bonk-3-bonks-big-adventure/3030-11312/\" slug=\"bonk-3-bonks-big-adventure\">Bonk 3</a> is largely unchanged from its predecessors, retaining a very similar plot and similar gameplay.

The levels also varied much more than its predecessors, ranging from the inside of a dinosaur to the moon (Super Bonk even has a shooter minigame).</p><h3>Chou Genjin 2</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1311661-cg2_ss6.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1311661\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.87109375\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.1%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1311661-cg2_ss6.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1311661\"><img alt=\"The second Bonk game to be released on the SNES.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/1311661-cg2_ss6.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/1311661-cg2_ss6.png 256w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The second Bonk game to be released on the SNES.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/1311661-cg2_ss6.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/1311661-cg2_ss6.png 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The second Bonk game to be released on the SNES.</figcaption></figure><p>Also known as Super Bonk 2, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-30538\" href=\"/chou-genjin-2/3030-30538/\" slug=\"chou-genjin-2\">Chou Genjin 2</a> was a Super Famicom exclusive game released in 1995. The game was largely different from previous iterations of the game, including power-ups from nearly every previous game (including a cavewoman who was not seen since the arcade version of Bonk's Adventure). In addition, Bonk's abilities are taken much more advantage of, something that was almost unheard of in previous games. Despite these changes, the game was much more difficult than other Bonk games, implementing a system where, upon dying the level must be completely started over.</p><h3>Bonk: Brink of Extinction</h3><p>A canceled game in the Bonk franchise, Hudson Soft announced <a data-ref-id=\"3030-28009\" href=\"/bonk-brink-of-extinction/3030-28009/\" slug=\"bonk-brink-of-extinction\">Bonk: Brink of Extinction</a> for release on <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2695\" href=\"/wiiware/3015-2695/\" slug=\"wiiware\">WiiWare</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3045-88\" href=\"/playstation-network-ps3/3045-88/\" slug=\"playstation-network-ps3\">PlayStation Network</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3045-86\" href=\"/xbox-live-marketplace/3045-86/\" slug=\"xbox-live-marketplace\">Xbox Live Arcade</a> during 2010. The game was set to include new power-ups for Bonk (such as Fire Bonk, a fireball spitting version of Bonk), cooperative play (both online and local), and new minigames that can be played in between levels. Some of the game's plot was revealed, stating that a large comet was set to wipe Bonk's world out, and it's up to him to stop this from happening. The game was canceled shortly before it was set to release.</p><h3>Air Zonk</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1108633-gfs_57376_2_73_mid.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1108633\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.93333333333333\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:93.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1108633-gfs_57376_2_73_mid.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1108633\"><img alt=\"Zonk blasts through a variety of enemies from the Bonk franchise.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/33529/1108633-gfs_57376_2_73_mid.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/3/33529/1108633-gfs_57376_2_73_mid.jpg 540w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1108633-gfs_57376_2_73_mid.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/33529/1108633-gfs_57376_2_73_mid.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Zonk blasts through a variety of enemies from the Bonk franchise.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/33529/1108633-gfs_57376_2_73_mid.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/3/33529/1108633-gfs_57376_2_73_mid.jpg 540w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1108633-gfs_57376_2_73_mid.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/33529/1108633-gfs_57376_2_73_mid.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Zonk blasts through a variety of enemies from the Bonk franchise.</figcaption></figure><p>Released in 1992, Air Zonk is a spin-off of the Bonk franchise, starring a futuristic Bonk lookalike named Zonk.

The game is widely regarded as being one of the best shooters of the TurboGrafx-16, coming from the same developers of another critically acclaimed TurboGrafx-16 shooter titled <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20937\" href=\"/gate-of-thunder/3030-20937/\" slug=\"gate-of-thunder\">Gates of Thunder</a>. Air Zonk even won some awards, such as Best TurboGrafx-16 Game of 1992, from Electronic Gaming Monthly.</p><p>The game stars the titular Zonk, who shoots his way through a variety of enemies, and eventually a boss in each level. In each level, Zonk can use a sidekick or assistant who helps him perform special moves and even attack enemies on its own. These companions are chosen manually before each level, but can only be used once. The companion is activated upon collecting five small smiley faces, and then will assist Zonk. However, if Zonk collects another large smiley face while the assistant is active, Zonk and the companion will merge together with a special ability and temporary invulnerability.</p><h3>Super Air Zonk: Rockabilly Paradise</h3><p>The second game to star Zonk, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20973\" href=\"/super-air-zonk-rockabilly-paradise/3030-20973/\" slug=\"super-air-zonk-rockabilly-paradise\">Super Air Zonk: Rockabilly Paradise</a>, was released in 1993 for the TurboGrafx-CD.

Like many of the previous games in the series the player gets to see the combat from different perspectives. The view can change from a member of the British SAS to a United States Marine. The missions take place during a fictional war in the near future between the United States, the United Kingdom and Russia, all three fighting against Russian ultra-nationalists after a civil war has torn Russia apart.</p><p>A new feature to the game\u2019s multiplayer is the addition of a unique leveling-up RPG-like experience point system. This new addition allows players to gain experience points (XP) and use that XP to not only gain rank, but to also unlock new weapons, weapon attachments, weapon camouflages and equipment. The game features a level-cap of 55, but Infinity Ward has added a feature, Prestige Mode, to the console versions to satisfy those who want to go above and beyond. Essentially, when players hit the level-cap of 55, they are given an option: they can either remain at level 55, or enter Prestige Mode. Prestige Mode basically is a \u201cstart over\u201d button where players rollback to level 1 and start all over again. They retain none of the perks, guns, or equipment they had previously gained through those 54 levels.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1840/356654-cod4_4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-356654\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1840/356654-cod4_4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-356654\"><img alt=\"Captain Price in a helicopter from the first official mission in the game\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/0/1840/356654-cod4_4.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/1840/356654-cod4_4.jpg 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/0/1840/356654-cod4_4.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/1840/356654-cod4_4.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\"></a><figcaption>Captain Price in a helicopter from the first official mission in the game</figcaption></figure><p>COD4 allows players to go through 10 levels of Prestige, each with their specific emblem. That lets players hit a level of 495. In addition to the XP system, the game also allows players to create their own specific class using Perks. There are three categories of Perks that players can choose from, with different perks within each category. These Perks vary from category to category. For example, the Perk 1 category mainly revolves around what type of equipment your created class can carry, be it claymores, C4 or RPGs. The remaining two Perk categories largely affect your class\u2019 specific gameplay attributes. These Perks include the ability to reload your gun faster, take more damage, or even to carry two primary weapons.</p><p>The different Perks categories are divided in such a way as to not allow any player to gain a vastly significant advantage over any other player. For example, players can\u2019t create a class that uses the Juggernaut perk (increased health) AND the Stopping Power perk (increased bullet damage). The game allows players to create up to five separate custom classes. This gives players the ability to create custom classes better suited for different game types without having to constantly change their perks. For example, players may simply switch from their \u201cStealth\u201d class after playing Search and Destroy to their \u201cOne Man Army\u201d class when they hop into Deathmatch. Infinity Ward\u2019s inclusion of the Perks system allows for a varied and unique online gameplay experience.</p><p>In addition to the XP and Perks systems, Infinity Ward also added their own \u2018Achievement\u2019-like system into the multiplayer. The achievements, called challenges, vary in both difficulty and type. Some are strictly based on how many kills you can get with a single gun, while others are more focused on gameplay. Example of this type of achievement are stabbing 5 enemies in a row without dying, or killing an enemy by shooting his own C4. Accomplishing these in-game achievements also give you XP, helping to boost your overall multiplayer rank.</p><p>COD4 was the first game in the series to have killstreak rewards. Getting 3 kills in one life grants a UAV that will mark enemies on the map for the entire team for a short duration; 5 kills grants an airstrike that hits the location the player targets; and 7 kills grants a helicopter that hovers around the map for a limited time attacking enemy players.</p><p>Call of Duty 4 was a significant turning point for the series, causing every future entry in the franchise to have a much bigger emphasis on competitive multiplayer and also inspiring other developers to incorporate multiplayer in their games as well.</p><ul><li><b><a href=\"/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare/3030-25636/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-25636\">Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare (DS)</a></b></li></ul><p>Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare for the Nintendo DS is a companion storyline for its larger scaled counterpart.

The series first debuted on September 26, 1986 in Japan, with the release of <a href=\"/castlevania/3030-6673/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6673\">Demon Castle Dracula</a> for the <a href=\"/nintendo-entertainment-system/3045-21/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-21\">Nintendo Famicon</a>. A different version of the game, <a href=\"/vampire-killer/3030-290/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-290\">Vampire Killer</a>, was released for the <a href=\"/msx/3045-15/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-15\">MSX2</a> platform a month later. Castlevania had to wait for its North American release on the <a href=\"/nes/3045-21/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-21\">Nintendo Entertainment System</a> in 1987 before it gathered any International recognition. The series soon became a recognized landmark in action platforming games and has since gathered a rather large cult following. The <i>Castlevania</i> series is highly regarded among gamers and has remained popular since its original release. While it was known in Japan as \"Akumajo Dracula\", or \"Demon Castle Dracula\", the English name \"Castlevania\" was not meant to mean anything, aside from suggesting the game's setting of a castle and being reminiscent of \"<a href=\"/transylvania/3035-941/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-941\">Transylvania</a>\", the traditional home of Count Dracula. However, twenty-eight years after the release of the original game, the term came to mean something in-universe, when 2014's <a href=\"/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-2/3030-38438/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-38438\">Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2</a> put the player in a modern-day setting, a human metropolis built atop the ruins of Dracula's castle called \"Castlevania City\".</p><p>The early games in the <i>Castlevania</i> series borrowed material and influences from classic horror cinema. Later, the series was influenced heavily by Gothic fiction and dark romanticism, and the most recent <a href=\"/nintendo-ds/3045-52/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-52\">Nintendo DS</a> outing has adopted an anime-inspired art direction.</p><p>The <i>Castlevania</i> series is one of Konami's most famous and successful franchises, and various games has been released on the Nintendo Entertainment System, <a href=\"/snes/3045-9/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\">Super Nintendo</a>, <a href=\"/nintendo-64/3045-43/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-43\">Nintendo 64</a>, <a href=\"/genesis/3045-6/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-6\">Sega Mega Drive</a>, <a href=\"/saturn/3045-42/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-42\">Sega Saturn</a>, <a href=\"/turbografx-16/3045-55/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-55\">PC Engine</a>, <a href=\"/playstation/3045-22/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-22\">PlayStation</a>, <a href=\"/playstation-2/3045-19/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-19\">Playstation 2</a>, <a href=\"/xbox/3045-32/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-32\">Xbox</a>, <a href=\"/nintendo-ds/3045-52/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-52\">Nintendo DS</a>, <a href=\"/game-boy/3045-3/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-3\">Game Boy</a>, <a href=\"/game-boy-advance/3045-4/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-4\">Game Boy Advance</a>, <a href=\"/psp/3045-18/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-18\">PSP</a>, MSX2, <a href=\"/commodore-64/3045-14/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-14\">C64</a>, <a href=\"/sharp-x68000/3045-95/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-95\">Sharp X6800</a>, and <a href=\"/pc/3045-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a> platforms.</p><h2>Characters</h2><h3>The Belmont Family</h3><p>The Belmont bloodline is sworn to oppose <a href=\"/dracula/3005-348/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-348\">Dracula</a> in all his various forms. In most <i>Castlevania</i> games, the main character is of Belmont decent; if not, the Belmonts are usually present in the form of supporting characters. The main weapon of choice for the Belmont family is the ancestral whip, named \"<i>Vampire Killer</i>\". It has been said that only members of the Belmont family can use the whip; anyone else will eventually die after using it.</p><h3>Dracula</h3><p><a href=\"/dracula/3005-348/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-348\">Dracula</a> has been the main antagonist throughout the Castlevania series, though the portrayal of the character has varied over time. Dracula's full name is Dracula Vlad Tepes. He was originally depicted as a standard villain, but the character became much more dramatic as more titles were released. Dracula has always played an important role in the series; his legacy stays even in <a href=\"/castlevania-aria-of-sorrow/3030-12036/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12036\">Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow</a>, a game taking place after he was defeated and slain once and for all. In the games where Dracula is present, he often dresses the way the original Dracula was conceived: a black suit with a long cape.</p><h2>Franchise History</h2><p>The first outing of the <i>Castlevania</i> series, the original <a href=\"/castlevania/3030-6673/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6673\">Castlevania</a> for the NES, was a typical platform game in where the player controlled the game's protagonist <a href=\"/simon-belmont/3005-86/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-86\">Simon Belmont</a>, a descendant of the Belmont Clan (see characters section). Simon ventures inside <i>Castlevania</i>, a vast demonic castle ruled by Count Dracula, where he fights supernatural beasts on his way to Dracula. He eventually makes his way through the castle interior to the top of the Castle, where the final boss fight traditionally is (most often, Dracula himself) in the <i>Castlevania</i> games. Belmont has to slay the evil Count Dracula using a family relic passed down generation to generation named the \"<a href=\"/vampire-killer/3055-284/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-284\">Vampire Killer</a>\", which was blessed with the power to destroy vampires and other creatures of the night. Simon and the game's other heroes also possess secondary weapons, powered by hearts, which can be found by destroying candles (and enemies in later games).</p><p>A different version of the game, <a href=\"/vampire-killer/3030-290/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-290\">Vampire Killer</a>, was released for the MSX2 computer platform a month later. This version introduced <a href=\"/metroidvania/3015-2440/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2440\">Metroidvania</a> elements, allowing <a href=\"/open-world/3015-207/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-207\">open-world</a> exploration within a fortress environment, much like <a href=\"/metroid/3030-21761/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21761\">Metroid</a> earlier that year.</p><p>The first sequel, <a href=\"/castlevania-ii-simons-quest/3030-11820/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11820\">Castlevania II: Simon's Quest</a>, introduced several <a href=\"/rpg-elements/3015-3603/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3603\">RPG elements</a>, such as a non-linear world the player was free to explore and <a href=\"/backtracking/3015-239/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-239\">revisit</a>, the ability to <a href=\"/shopping/3015-1103/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1103\">purchase</a> supplies, equipment and <a href=\"/upgradeable-weapons/3015-133/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-133\">weapon upgrades</a> in various small <a href=\"/town/3035-1244/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1244\">towns</a>, and (more importantly) a <a href=\"/leveling-up/3015-475/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-475\">leveling up</a> system.</p><p>The third game, <a href=\"/castlevania-iii-draculas-curse/3030-19328/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19328\">Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse</a>, returned to the traditional style and gameplay of the original game while updating it with new features such as <a href=\"/branching-story-line/3015-1646/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1646\">alternate paths</a> with new stages and multiple playable characters.

By using a wide-open world that the player was free to explore, similar to that seen previously in its predecessor Castlevania II as well as <a href=\"/super-metroid/3030-8292/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8292\">Super Metroid</a>, <i>Symphony of the Night</i> popularized what is now commonly referred to as the \"<a href=\"/metroidvania/3015-2440/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2440\">Metroidvania</a>\" style of gameplay, where the player is allowed to roam free in the game's environment but was only allowed access to a small number of areas at first. The rest of the game's areas are reached by doing certain tasks, such as completing a boss fight or finding objects and new abilities that let the player access new areas. This, combined with console RPG elements such as experience levels, hit points and magic points, usable items and the collection of new powers and abilities, weapons, armour and various items defines this style.</p><p>In addition to reinventing the technical aspects of Castlevania, <i>Symphony</i> <i>of the Night</i> adopted an entirely new art direction for the Castlevania world in which the games took place and the characters within them. With the joining of illustrator and concept artist <a href=\"/ayami-kojima/3040-40903/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-40903\">Ayami Kojima</a> onto the development team beginning with <i>Symphony</i> <i>of the Night</i>, the design underwent a total transformation into an elegant, beautiful appearance inspired by the European Baroque art periods (a style popular in Japan), effectively ending its previous Gothic horror theme. As such, the characters' dress and condition evolved into grand ensembles including flowing jackets and vests, and the imagery, landscape of the castle, and other game locations became lush and lavish.</p><p>The two Nintendo DS Castlevania games' art style reverted back to a more anime-inspired and simpler style similar to that of the original <a href=\"/castlevania-rondo-of-blood/3030-12673/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12673\">Dracula X: Rondo of Blood</a>. Through this, Konami hoped to broaden the player demographic by persuading the (presumably slightly younger) DS gaming audience to not be put off by the otherwise mature image of Kojima's art.</p><p>The first games in the series made with 3D graphics were <a href=\"/castlevania/3030-22950/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-22950\">Castlevania <i>(</i>64)</a> and <a href=\"/castlevania-legacy-of-darkness/3030-6467/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6467\">Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness</a>, both on the Nintendo 64. The reception they received was mixed at best, and sales were lackluster. These games are not as highly regarded by fans and are not often recognized or referred to positively. <i>Symphony of the Night,</i> as well as <a href=\"/castlevania-dawn-of-sorrow/3030-11321/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11321\"><i>Dawn of Sorrow</i></a> &amp; <a href=\"/castlevania-portrait-of-ruin/3030-14357/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14357\"><i>Portrait of Ruin</i></a>, both on the DS, also occasionally used 3D backgrounds.</p><p>Series creator and director Koji Igarashi has stated his interest in returning to the more traditional style of the earlier games in the series, but left Konami before he was able to implement this questionable decision.</p><p>In 2010, the series' increasingly complex timeline was wiped clean with a reboot for the <a href=\"/xbox-360/3045-20/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-20\">Xbox 360</a> and <a href=\"/playstation-3/3045-35/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-35\">PlayStation 3</a>, <a href=\"/castlevania-lords-of-shadow/3030-23704/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-23704\">Castlevania: Lords of Shadow</a>, taking place in 1047 and depicting the quest of <a href=\"/gabriel-belmont/3005-12350/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-12350\">Gabriel Belmont</a>, the first member of the family in this new universe. Lords of Shadow abandoned much of the framework of the previous games, and instead told Gabriel's story in the form of a character action game similar to <a href=\"/god-of-war/3030-6959/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6959\">God of War</a>. Although the gameplay and storyline were critically praised, Lords of Shadow was criticized for its lack of traditional Castlevania elements, such as losing a large, explorable map in favour of a series of linear levels that players can replay with new items in order to get to treasures that were previously out of reach. Additionally, some fans of the original storyline took offence with the controversial ending.</p><p>It was followed by the <a href=\"/nintendo-3ds/3045-117/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-117\">Nintendo 3DS</a> title <a href=\"/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-mirror-of-fate/3030-38437/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-38437\">Castlevania: Lords of Shadow - Mirror of Fate</a> in 2012, a much more traditional side-scrolling, map-exploring affair, and 2014's <a href=\"/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-2/3030-38438/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-38438\">Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2</a> for the PS3, 360, and <a href=\"/pc/3045-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a>. Although Lords of Shadow 2 is primarily a character action game like the original Lords of Shadow, it implemented many changes to make the gameplay more like the traditional games in the franchise, such as making the world consist of two large, fully explorable regions that the player could freely wander about in, although the storyline does prod the player along a single linear path. It was, however, criticized for the questionable inclusion of <a href=\"/stealth/3015-24/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-24\">stealth</a> sequences that were generally regarded as unnecessary and somewhat frustrating.</p><p>It was officially stated that Lords of Shadow 2 would be the final game in the reboot series, though it currently remains to be seen whether the franchise will go back to the overcomplicated original storyline, start over a second time with another reboot, or even whether that was a simple marketing lie and the next game will still take place in the Lords of Shadow universe.</p><h2>Original Chronology</h2><p>When <a href=\"/koji-igarashi/3040-40883/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-40883\">Koji Igarashi</a> took over as producer for the series, he revised the timeline and removed <a href=\"/castlevania-legends/3030-12001/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12001\">Castlevania Legends</a>, Castlevania (64), Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness, and <a href=\"/castlevania-circle-of-the-moon/3030-13197/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13197\">Castlevania: Circle of the Moon</a>. Reasons for these changes have never been clearly stated.</p><p>With the release of Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin however, Konami of America included a pre-order bonus \"20th Anniversary\" package that included a Castlevania series timeline. This timeline re-added all the games previously omitted besides Castlevania Legends. This timeline was altered once again the following year on the official Japanese Castlevania series website. This is the most current official timeline, and is what is listed below. <a href=\"/castlevania-order-of-ecclesia/3030-20627/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20627\">Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia</a> was not out when the timeline was made, but has since been retroactively added by the community.</p><table data-max-width=\"false\"><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\">Year</th><th scope=\"col\">Game</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>1094</strong></td><td><a href=\"/castlevania-lament-of-innocence/3030-15790/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15790\">Castlevania: Lament of Innocence</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>1476</strong></td><td><a href=\"/castlevania-iii-draculas-curse/3030-19328/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19328\">Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>1479</strong></td><td><a href=\"/castlevania-curse-of-darkness/3030-4493/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4493\">Castlevania: Curse of Darkness</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>1576</strong></td><td><a href=\"/the-castlevania-adventure/3030-8654/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8654\">Castlevania: The Adventure</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>1591</strong></td><td><a href=\"/castlevania-ii-belmonts-revenge/3030-16921/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16921\">Castlevania II: Belmont's Revenge</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>1691</strong></td><td><a href=\"/castlevania/3030-6673/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6673\">Castlevania</a> / <a href=\"/castlevania-chronicles/3030-15819/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15819\">Castlevania Chronicles</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>1698</strong></td><td><a href=\"/castlevania-ii-simons-quest/3030-11820/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11820\">Castlevania II: Simon's Quest</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>1748</strong></td><td><a href=\"/castlevania-harmony-of-dissonance/3030-18040/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18040\">Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>1792</strong></td><td><a href=\"/akumajo-dracula-x-chi-no-rondo/3030-12673/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12673\">Castlevania: Rondo of Blood</a> / <a href=\"/castlevania-dracula-x/3030-10975/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10975\">Castlevania: Dracula X</a> / <a href=\"/castlevania-the-dracula-x-chronicles/3030-16851/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16851\">Castlevania: The Dracula X Chronicles</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>1797</strong></td><td><a href=\"/castlevania-symphony-of-the-night/3030-14216/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14216\">Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>18</strong>??</td><td><a href=\"/\">Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>1917</strong></td><td><a href=\"/castlevania-bloodlines/3030-945/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-945\">Castlevania: Bloodlines</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>1944</strong></td><td><a href=\"/castlevania-portrait-of-ruin/3030-14357/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14357\">Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>2035</strong></td><td><a href=\"/castlevania-aria-of-sorrow/3030-12036/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12036\">Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>2036</strong></td><td><a href=\"/castlevania-dawn-of-sorrow/3030-11321/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11321\">Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow</a></td></tr></tbody></table>", "guid": "3025-86", "name": "Castlevania"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-87", "name": "Centipede"}, {"description": "<p>Control a blue chameleon as he jumps around hitting flying ice cream sandwiches with his tongue</p>", "guid": "3025-88", "name": "Chameleon Twist"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-89", "name": "Chase HQ"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-90", "name": "Ch\u014d Aniki"}, {"description": "<p>Designed by <a href=\"/takara-co-ltd/3010-110/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-110\">Takara</a> in 1978, <strong>Choro-Q</strong> are a brand of collectable toy car that are known for their unique super deformed appearance.</p><p>Aside from obvious racing games, recent titles are often referred to as \"Car-PGs\", adventure/racing game hybrids with the cars themselves as characters.</p><p>In the US, the series is usually known as \"<strong>Gadget Racers</strong>\" and it is often called \"<strong>Penny Racers</strong>\" in the UK.

It is considered to be one of the establishing franchises in the <a href=\"/4x/3015-214/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-214\">4X</a> genre of turn-based strategy games.</p><h2>Civilization</h2><p>Developed and published by <a href=\"/microprose-software-inc/3010-66/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-66\">MicroProse</a> in 1991, the original <a href=\"/sid-meiers-civilization/3030-3750/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3750\">Civilization</a> is generally considered to be one of the pioneering turn-based strategy games, which helped to establish the genre. An exclusively single-player game, the original Civilization has players take on the role of the leading figurehead of one of many different civilizations across the world, and challenges the player to develop an empire while in direct competition with up to six other civilizations across the planet. Players will need to micromanage certain aspects of their civilization as they slowly expand, explore new territory, advance their technology and knowledge-base, construct armies, conduct diplomatic negotiations, and defend their empire from aggressors. Each new game begins in the year 4000 BC, and can potentially last until the year 2100, which leads to advances in theoretical technology including a faster-than-light star drive, enabling the colonization of the <a href=\"/sid-meiers-alpha-centauri/3030-12379/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12379\">Alpha Centauri</a> star system. Players can win the game by either destroying all other civilizations, attaining the highest score at the end of the \"modern era\" or by winning a space race.</p><h2>Civilization II</h2><p>Released in 1996, <a href=\"/sid-meiers-civilization-ii/3030-217/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-217\">Civilization II</a> was one of the few Civ games not developed by Sid Meier. Civ II built upon the popularity and solid gameplay mechanics of the first game, but added some new mechanics of its own and completely revamped the look of the franchise, changing the way in which the game was displayed from a top-down, bird's eye view to a 3/4 isometric perspective. Changes were made to certain units and civilizations as a whole, new technologies were added, and the artificial intelligence was improved upon greatly, removing the majority of random events, and forcing the computer opponents to develop their civilizations in the exact same way as human players do. New game features include a system of hit points and firepower ratings, allowing units to be sent against each other based on their inherent strengths and weaknesses, as well as giving the player the ability to consult a High Council of live-action actors portraying stereotypical government advisers, whom gave the player various bits of advice on how to proceed through the game. Like the previous game, players can win by either destroying or conquering all other civilizations, or by constructing a starship and colonizing the Alpha Centauri system before any other empire. The popularity of Civ II led to the production and release of two expansion packs, a second, stand-alone title under the Civ II series and a multiplayer addition to the original:</p><ul><li><u><b>Civilization II: Conflicts in Civilization</b></u><br /><a href=\"/sid-meiers-civilization-ii-conflicts-in-civilization-scenarios/3030-20075/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20075\">Conflicts in Civilization</a> added an additional 20 new scenarios to the core game, eight of which were created by fans. Additionally, it added an enhanced macro language for fans that wanted to script their own scenarios. Some of the twelve scenarios created by MicroProse included the American Civil War, an Alien Invasion, A World War in 1979, and a post-apocalpytic attempt at rebuilding civilization.</li><li><u><b>Civilization II: Fantastic Worlds</b></u><br /><a href=\"/civilization-ii-fantastic-worlds/3030-6721/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6721\">Fantastic Worlds</a> provided an additional 19 scenarios for the original game that were based on science-fiction or fantasy settings, including tributes to games like <a href=\"/x-com-ufo-defense/3030-196/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-196\">X-COM</a> and <a href=\"/master-of-orion/3030-11342/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11342\">Master of Orion</a>. Additionally, the game shipped with several intuitive tools for fans to use to produce their own scenarios or edit existing levels.</li></ul><ul><li><u><b>Civilization II: Multiplayer Gold Edition</b></u><br />The <a href=\"/civilization-ii-multiplayer-gold-edition/3030-7083/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7083\">Multiplayer Gold Edition</a> of Civilization II added multiplay to a Civilization game for the first time in the franchise, and included all of the scenarios from the Conflicts in Civilization and Fantastic Worlds expansion packs, as well as the scenario-editing utilities for fans to produce their own content.</li></ul><ul><li><u><b>Civilization II: Test of Time</b></u><br />A stand-alone title bearing the Civilization II name, <a href=\"/civilization-ii-test-of-time/3030-1102/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1102\">Test of Time</a> provided the original Civilization II single- and multiplayer campaigns with significantly improved graphics and effects, as well as two original campaigns centered around science fiction and fantasy/Norse mythology settings.</li></ul><h2>Civilization III</h2><p>Developed by <a href=\"/firaxis-games/3010-361/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-361\">Firaxis Games</a> and published by <a href=\"/infogrames/3010-128/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-128\">Infogrames</a>, <a href=\"/sid-meiers-civilization-iii/3030-1594/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1594\">Civilization III</a> continued to improve upon the graphic fidelity of Civilization II and Test of Time. It also significantly changed a large portion of the game mechanics and features from Civilization II. The core gameplay of the franchise remains, but the amount of micromanagement required from players to manage their civilizations and push their empires forward was increased. The victory conditions of the game were expanded upon, allowing players to complete the game in a number of ways, including conquest of all other civilizations; gaining control of at least two-thirds of the world's land mass and population; utilizing a new cultural mechanic to generate a global desire to be a part of the player's empire; being elected the United Nations Secretary General; and producing a colony ship to travel to the Alpha Centauri star system. Additional changes of any significance include diplomatic agreements, forced labor/slavery, and line-of-site functionality for units at different altitudes. Civilization III's nearly universal acclaim led to the release of two expansion packs, which added new scenarios and multiplayer capabilities:</p><ul><li><u><b>Civilization III: Play the World</b></u><br />The first expansion pack for Civ III, <a href=\"/sid-meiers-civilization-iii-play-the-world/3030-20424/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20424\">Play the World</a> added several new civilizations to play as and compete against, a multiplayer feature, new units, new modes play, including a \"turnless\" game type, which unsuccessfully attempted to blend turn-based and real time gameplay together over multiplayer.</li><li><u><b>Civilization III: Conquests</b></u><br /><a href=\"/sid-meiers-civilization-iii-conquests/3030-3242/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3242\">Conquests</a> supplemented the original Cvilization III and Play the world with seven additional civilizations, bringing the total for the series to 31. Additionally, the game provided two new traits for Civ III, which were utilized to specify a particular civilizations' cultural strengths or weaknesses. Two new governmental bodies were added, as well as four new bonus resources, two new terrain types, and nine new scenarios for use over multiplayer.</li></ul><h2>Civilization IV</h2><p>Developed by Sid Meier and <a href=\"/soren-johnson/3040-51090/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-51090\">Soren Johnson</a>, <a href=\"/sid-meiers-civilization-iv/3030-16457/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16457\">Civilization IV</a> was released in 2005 to nearly universal acclaim, and further improved the franchise for a new generation of computer hardware and gameplay expectations. Players can now research up to 86 different technologies, and must micromanage even more aspects of their empire than ever before, including several features new to the Civilization series. Players can now utilize Great People, which provide bonuses or special buildings, they must deal with the creation and spread of various religions, they must maintain their cities to prevent them from falling to corruption or over expenditure, and the overarching governmental system was replaced with civic models representing different societal divisions (Legal, Economy, Religion, etc). Additionally, the United Nations can pass binding resolutions, the artificial intelligence can no longer view the entire game world at the beginning of each game, and military forces are no longer as complicated as before, with their many individual ratings broken down to a single \"strength\" statistic. Finally, many graphical enhancements were integrated, including a switch to a fully 3D engine which allows players to freely zoom between many levels of detail. Just like the previous two games, the overwhelming popularity of Civ IV led to the release of two expansion packs:</p><ul><li><u><b>Civilization IV: Warlords</b></u><br />The first expansion pack for Civilization IV, <a href=\"/sid-meiers-civilization-iv-warlords/3030-8382/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8382\">Warlords</a> added many new features to the core game, including a new category of Great People (known as Great Generals), the ability to create vassal states, new units and resources, six new civilizations to control or conquer, eight new scenarios, and several other additions.</li><li><u><b>Civilization IV: Beyond the Sword</b></u><br />The second expansion pack for Civilzation IV, <a href=\"/sid-meiers-civilization-iv-beyond-the-sword/3030-19287/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19287\">Beyond the Sword</a> focused on adding new content to the game that occurred after the creation of gunpowder. A total of 11 new scenarios, 10 new civilizations, 25 new units, and 16 new leaders were included in the game, and the expansion pack additionally allowed players to create corporations, conduct espionage, expend more time and effort to attain Space Race or Diplomatic victories, and start an advanced nation with several key components towards establishing a powerful empire already in place.</li></ul><h2>Civilization Revolution</h2><p><a href=\"../../sid-meier/72-4212/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Sid Meier's</a> Civilization: Revolution was developed by <a href=\"../../firaxis-games/65-361/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Firaxis</a> and published by <a href=\"../../2k-games/65-360/\" rel=\"nofollow \">2K Games</a> for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, DS, and iPhone. A Wii version was in development but was placed on hold in 2007.

The square grid used by past games was replaced by a hexagonal one, and unit stacking was removed. The game was made more tactical, in the vein of strategy games like <a href=\"/panzer-general/3025-894/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-894\">Panzer General</a>. Important features from Civilization IV like religion and espionage were removed, while new features like city-states and social policies were introduced. However, the core gameplay remained mostly the same, micromanaging your empire and its cities to bring your civilization to victory. Civilization V also introduced the series to <a href=\"/downloadable-content/3015-329/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-329\">DLC</a>, selling civilizations, scenarios and map packs outside of the expansion format.</p><ul><li><u><b>Civilization V: Gods &amp; Kings</b></u><br />Developed by Ed Beach, <a href=\"/sid-meiers-civilization-v-gods-kings/3030-37508/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-37508\">Gods &amp; Kings</a> adds religion and espionage, two highly requested features, back into Civilization.

The game is similar to <a data-ref-id=\"3025-291\" href=\"/tetris/3025-291/\" slug=\"tetris\">        Tetris</a> in gameplay style and basic concepts, although there are many drastic differences between Columns and other block dropping puzzle games. In Columns, the goal is to match three off the same color horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. In addition, Columns only has vertically shaped blocks \"three part blocks,\" where the three symbols inside can be flipped around to match them up.<br/><br/>Other versions of Columns were later released, most notably a Game Gear version, a Game Boy Color version titled <a data-ref-id=\"3030-7075\" href=\"/columns-gb-tezuka-osamu-characters/3030-7075/\" slug=\"columns-gb-tezuka-osamu-characters\">       Columns GB: Tezuka Osamu Characters</a>, and a 1997 arcade update of the game titled Columns '97. The Game Gear version differed in a few aspects, particularly the music, graphics, and the ability to change exactly what the symbols were inside the blocks. The Game Boy Color version, Columns GB, added several characters that were created by <a data-ref-id=\"3040-91567\" href=\"/tezuka-osamu/3040-91567/\" slug=\"tezuka-osamu\">      Tezuka Osamu</a>, including Kimba, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-7796\" href=\"/astro-boy/3005-7796/\" slug=\"astro-boy\">     Astro Boy</a>, and Unico.

Columns II did little to expand on the franchise, only adding a few notable things. The graphical change is notable, particularly evidenced with the pixel art of the game's title screen. Also on a graphical note, Columns II introduced the option to change what background the game had, which has since become a series standard. Beyond these changes, nothing was changed beyond graphical updates.<br/><br/><h3>Columns III: Revenge of Columns</h3><br/>With the release of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-15020\" href=\"/columns-iii-revenge-of-columns/3030-15020/\" slug=\"columns-iii-revenge-of-columns\">   Columns III</a>, the franchise was brought back to its console roots. The game was released in 1993 for the Sega Genesis (as well as an arcade version). Despite the naming discrepancy, Columns III actually does very little to differentiate itself from other games in the franchise. The most major thing that Columns III changes is the fact that players are now required to play against an opponent at all times. In addition, Columns III has a separate story mode, it adds new special blocks (which make a certain symbol disappear from the playing field), and the ability to have multiplayer with up to five players simultaneously.<br/><br/><h3>Super Columns</h3><br/>The first handheld exclusive game in the franchise, Super Columns was released in 1995 for the Game Gear. Super Columns is particularly notable for being the pack-in game for the Game Gear. The largest change that Super Columns made to the traditional gameplay is actually one of the biggest changes in the Columns franchise. This game adds the ability to flip blocks horizontally, rather than constricting blocks to constantly stay vertical. Super Columns also has a story in which the player must fight against a corrupt merchant who wants to use a jewel to his advantage.<br/><br/><h3>Columns Crown   </h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1310523-columns_crown01.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1310523\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1310523-columns_crown01.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1310523\"><img alt=\"\u00a0Columns Crown adds power-ups and versus play.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px\" data-width=\"240\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/1310523-columns_crown01.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/1310523-columns_crown01.png 240w\"><noscript><img alt=\"\u00a0Columns Crown adds power-ups and versus play.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/1310523-columns_crown01.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/1310523-columns_crown01.png 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px\" data-width=\"240\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0Columns Crown adds power-ups and versus play.</figcaption></figure> <br/>The most recent release in the Columns franchise, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-1271\" href=\"/columns-crown/3030-1271/\" slug=\"columns-crown\">  Columns Crown</a> was released on December 13, 2001 in North America for the Game Boy Advance. The game is a loose remake of Super Columns, expanding the story, upgrading the graphics, and adding certain gameplay elements. Columns Crown adds the ability to use power-ups, which can either be an offensive or defensive ability. For example, Quake will shake the opponent's screen and Freeze will stop the blocks on the opponent's screen. In addition to power-ups, Columns Crown adds the ability to play versus games over the Game Boy Advance Link Cable in both single and multi-cartridge play.", "guid": "3025-97", "name": "Columns"}, {"description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Command &amp; Conquer is a long-running series of real-time strategy games created by <a href=\"/joseph-bostic/3040-1004/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-1004\">Joseph Bostic</a> and <a href=\"/brett-sperry/3040-1005/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-1005\">Brett W.

After feedback from players invited to play the alpha, the game was cancelled in 2013 and a statement was released saying, \"Your feedback from the alpha trial is clear: We are not making the game you want to play.\" Victory Games was shuttered the same day.

This game started the tradition of full motion videos that the series has now been known for. The crux of the conflict between GDI and Nod is the discovery of a toxic, yet powerful extraterrestrial subtance called Tiberium, which landed on Earth via an asteroid impact.</p><p>This alien substance extracts surrounding nutrients and forms toxic crystals rich in valuable metals. However, Tiberium is quickly destroying Earth's natural habitats and ecosystems and spreading rapidly, turning the Earth into a barren wastleland.</p><p>The primary goals of GDI are to research a way to reverse the harmful environmental effects of Tiberium and stop the global militant insurgency of the Brotherhood of Nod. Nod, on the other hand, see Tiberium as a supreme gift from God that will allow the oppressive and unfair global order to be overthrown and replaced with a new brotherhood of humanity that will be more equitable to all. Nod is aggressively researching Tiberium-based technologies, especially weapons, to fuel their war against GDI. Their leader, Kane, proclaims his vision of turning the world into a Tiberium-based ecosystem.</p><p>The GDI campaign ends with the destruction of the Temple of Nod and the apparent death of Kane. The GDI ending is considered canon, and is continued from in the sequel. The Nod campaign ends with Nod gaining control of GDI's ultimate weapon, the Ion Cannon, and choosing a high-priority target to obliterate, symbolizing their achieved dominance over GDI.</p><p>One expansion pack and one spin-off title followed the original C&amp;C in <a href=\"/command-conquer-the-covert-operations/3030-11228/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11228\">Command &amp; Conquer: The Covert Operations</a> (1996) and <a href=\"/command-conquer-sole-survivor/3030-9687/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9687\">Command &amp; Conquer: Sole Survivor</a> (1997), respectively.

Covert Operations also set a precedent for <a href=\"/easter-egg/3015-2/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2\">easter eggs</a> in the Command &amp; Conquer series. Players could access a short secret campaign, complete with FMV intro movie featuring Kane asking the player to investigate \"strange reports\" that he's received, which turn out to be rampaging dinosaurs.</p><p>Sole Survivor was a multiplayer-only spinoff, which attempted to turn the original Command &amp; Conquer into a <a href=\"/quake/3030-8015/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8015\">Quake</a>-inspired multiplayer action game.

Westwood Studios developed the game but was bought by EA during its development. However, it did not have any effect on the development of the game. The plot picks off after the GDI ending of the first game, with the world continuing to suffer the effects of Tiberium resulting in the degeneration of the globe and UN, and the Brotherhood of Nod splintering into small pockets hiding around the globe after the death of Kane. In the GDI campaign, their forces work with the Forgotten (humans exposed to Tiberium and mutated) to combat the resurrection of Nod. They must deal with a Scrin Starship stranded on Earth and the return of Kane. The GDI campaign is considered canon and continued in the following expansion and sequel. In the Nod campaign the player must reunite the scattered Nod forces and work with Kane to bring about the destruction of Philadelphia, the GDI orbiting station and the resulting new world order.</p><p><a href=\"/command-conquer-tiberian-sun-firestorm/3030-22012/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-22012\">Command &amp; Conquer: Tiberian Sun: Firestorm</a> is the only expansion pack for Tiberian Sun. It takes the events of the GDI campaign of Tiberian Sun as its canon story, and follows where it left off. Unlike in the other campaigns of the Command &amp; Conquer franchise, the storylines of two opposing factions are not mutually exclusive. Although a player may play the campaigns in either order, their events mesh together to tell one cohesive story. Also unique in the franchise is that the final mission is identical in both campaigns. The plot sees defeated Nod remnants attempting to revive their forces by developing a highly advanced AI known as CABAL. However, the AI betrays Nod and forces GDI and Nod, forcing the two bitter enemies into into their first-ever alliance against a common foe.</p><h3>Command &amp; Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4344/944606-command_conquer_3_tiberium_wars.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-944606\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.2662889518414\" data-width=\"353\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 353px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:126.6%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4344/944606-command_conquer_3_tiberium_wars.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-944606\"><img alt=\"The beginning of Kane's box art dominance  \" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 505px) 100vw, 505px\" data-width=\"505\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/4344/944606-command_conquer_3_tiberium_wars.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/4344/944606-command_conquer_3_tiberium_wars.jpg 353w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The beginning of Kane's box art dominance  \" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/4344/944606-command_conquer_3_tiberium_wars.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/4344/944606-command_conquer_3_tiberium_wars.jpg 353w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 505px) 100vw, 505px\" data-width=\"505\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The beginning of Kane's box art dominance  </figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/command-conquer-3-tiberium-wars/3030-17551/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17551\">Command &amp; Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars</a>, takes place in the year of 2047, during the Third Tiberium War, which is ignited when the Brotherhood of Nod launches a worldwide offensive against the Global Defense Initiative who have been lulled into complacency after 17 years of peace since the last war. GDI's attention had turned to the rapid encroachment of poisonous Tiberium on population centers across the planet. Nod exploits the societal divisions produced by Tiberium's spread to mount a devastating surprise attack that sends GDI reeling. Nod launches a nuclear missle into the GDI orbiting command centre, the GDSS Philadelphia, cleanly decapitating the GDI hierarchy with one blow. GDI struggle to retaliate by swiftly attacking Nod's forces anywhere they can find them across the globe, especially in Egypt and Sarajevo. Temple Prime, the centre of the Brotherhood of Nod, comes under complete siege by GDI forces who are then ordered to use the Ion Cannon on it by the newly appointed director Redmond Boyle. By using the Ion Cannon on Temple Prime, GDI trigger a liquid Tiberium bomb created by Kane underneath Temple Prime to explode, which has catastrophic results around the globe. This huge explosion of Tiberium catches the attention of an alien faction, the <a href=\"/scrin/3015-2947/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2947\">Scrin</a>, who are deeply familiar with Tiberium. Kane knew of the Scrin and intended to draw them to Earth using a global Tiberium bomb, which could only be detonated with the extreme energy output of GDI's Ion Cannon, which he successfully baited GDI into using exactly as he wanted. As the Scrin swarm the entire Earth, GDI and Nod find themselves in a situation far more complex and dangerous than they had expected.</p><p>An expansion pack, <a href=\"/command-conquer-3-kanes-wrath/3030-20494/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20494\">Command &amp; Conquer 3: Kane's Wrath</a>, was released on March 24, 2008 for the PC. Kane's Wrath featured only a single faction campaign following Nod, a first for the franchise. The campaign is split up into 3 Acts, spanning a total of 13 missions from the time of Tiberian Sun: Firestorm through the Command and Conquer 3 main game and beyond. The entire campaign is played from the perspective of the AI, LEGION, a system created by Kane.</p><h3>Command &amp; Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9032/1329379-cc4tt_cover.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1329379\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.34375\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:134.4%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9032/1329379-cc4tt_cover.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1329379\"><img alt=\"The last game in the Tiberian saga  \" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/9032/1329379-cc4tt_cover.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/9032/1329379-cc4tt_cover.jpg 256w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The last game in the Tiberian saga  \" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/9032/1329379-cc4tt_cover.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/9032/1329379-cc4tt_cover.jpg 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The last game in the Tiberian saga  </figcaption></figure><p>The last game in the Tiberium arc, <a href=\"/command-conquer-4-tiberian-twilight/3030-27130/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-27130\">Command &amp; Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight</a> completes the saga that started the entire franchise. The game takes place in 2062, 15 years after the initial invasion of the Scrin. The game was released on March 16th, 2010. After the previous war, Tiberium has evolved further and is threatening all remaining life on the planet. In hopes of creating a \"Tiberium Network Control,\" a program designed to control the spread of Tiberium, Kane directs a meeting between the Brotherhood of Nod and GDI to pursue mutual interests. However, extremists on both sides disagree with this new coalition, provoking the Fourth Tiberium War. The game follows Kane's quest for \"ascension\" using Threshold 19, still intact after the previous war.</p><p>The game is notable for radically deviating from the traditional RTS-style gameplay of all previous C&amp;C games. Instead of the traditional resource gathering or base building of all prior C&amp;C games, Tiberian Twilight puts the player in control of a walker, an all-purpose unit, and gives the player effectively unlimited resources with which to churn out units. Strict population caps limit the size of armies and almost all units must be unlocked through a game-wide progression system that is shared between campaign, skirmish, and multiplayer.</p><h2>Red Alert Series</h2><p>Taking place in multiple universes where time travel is the norm, the Allies and Soviet Union fight for world supremacy in several alternate realities of World War II and subsequent conflicts. Later installments in the series see the a fictionalize version of Imperial Japan in the form of the Empire of the Rising Sun jump into the fray due to repeated meddling in the time continuum.</p><h3>Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2130/637220-ra.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-637220\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.131221719457\" data-width=\"442\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 442px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:113.1%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2130/637220-ra.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-637220\"><img alt=\"Red Alert!\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 565px) 100vw, 565px\" data-width=\"565\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/2130/637220-ra.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/2130/637220-ra.jpg 0w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Red Alert!\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/2130/637220-ra.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/2130/637220-ra.jpg 0w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 565px) 100vw, 565px\" data-width=\"565\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Red Alert!</figcaption></figure><p>The first installment in the series, <a href=\"/command-conquer-red-alert/3030-249/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-249\">Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert</a>, was originally positioned as a pseudo prequel to the original Command &amp; Conquer, but later allowed to stand apart as its own distinct universe. Starting in 1946, Albert Einstein uses his experimental Chronosphere (machine that manipulates spacetime) to send himself back decades before the start of World War II. He meets an unassuming Adolf Hitler and vaporizes him by creating a time paradox by shaking his hand.</p><p>This successfully preemptively eliminates the threat of Nazi Germany, but in its place rises the great Red Menace: the Soviet Union. Without Germany in the way, Stalin leads the growing Soviet Union, invading Asia and Eastern Europe, causing an alternate World War II. The free nations of the world join together to form the Allies, and try to push back Soviet encroachment.</p><p>The Allied ending is considered canon. The Soviet campaign and ending hinted that Kane, from the Tiberian universe, was surreptitiously manipulating the Soviets in the war to suit his own ends. This was the only evidence suggesting a shared universe between the Red Alert series and the Command &amp; Conquer series. However, EA has since put the kibosh on this and officially declared the two universes unique and not related to each other at all. No other evidence of crossover between the two universes has appeared in any subsequent games.</p><p>Red Alert was followed up with two expansion packs: <a href=\"/command-conquer-red-alert-counterstrike/3030-11328/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11328\">Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert: Counterstrike</a> and <a href=\"/command-conquer-red-alert-the-aftermath/3030-16365/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16365\">Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert: The Aftermath</a>. Counterstrike followed the blueprint of Westwood's previous expansion pack, Command &amp; Conquer: Covert Operations, by including 15 more stand-alone singleplayer missions, playable in any order, as well as more multiplayer maps and a short secret campaign fighting against an invasion of giant ants. Aftermath then added even more stand-alone singleplayer missions, ahandful of new units for both Allies and Soviets, and hundreds of more multiplayer maps, most developed by the game's community.</p><h3>Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 2</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/672499-373_63454500.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-672499\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4204545454545\" data-width=\"352\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 352px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:142.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/672499-373_63454500.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-672499\"><img alt=\"Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 2\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" data-width=\"450\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/672499-373_63454500.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/672499-373_63454500.jpg 352w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 2\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/672499-373_63454500.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/672499-373_63454500.jpg 352w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" data-width=\"450\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 2</figcaption></figure><p>The follow-up to the original Red Alert, <a href=\"/command-conquer-red-alert-2/3030-18072/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18072\">Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 2</a>, picks up after the conclusion of the Allied campaign in the first game. Just like the first, Red Alert 2 contains two playable factions: the Allies and Soviets. With Stalin and the rest of the Soviet hierarchy dead, the Allies set up a puppet in the Kremlin: Alexander Romanov. However, the Premier secretly rebuilds the Soviet army and launches an enormous surprise invasion of the Eastern coast of the US, catching the Allies off guard.

This game not only features the traditional Soviet and Allies factions, but also a new one, the Empire of the Rising Sun, based on hybrid of futuristic and Imperialistic Japan. The Soviet Union, realizing it was losing the war, decides to go back in time using a time machine to kill off Albert Einstein who was key to the Allies' technological supremacy. The newly resulting parallel universe has the Allies in decline with the Soviets still going strong. The Soviets at first believe their plan was a total success, when suddenly the Empire of the Rising Sun emerges on the global stage to embark on a campaign for world domination, beginning an new three-way war.</p><h3>Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3: Uprising</h3><p>A stand-alone expansion for Red Alert 3, <a href=\"/command-conquer-red-alert-3-uprising/3030-25034/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-25034\">Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3: Uprising</a>, takes place after the canon Allies victory, and features new units, four mini campaigns (one for each of the three factions and a fourth focused on the Rising Sun's hero unit, Yuriko Omega), as well as an extensive and difficult Commander's Challenge mode.</p><h2>Generals</h2><p>Unrelated to the fictional universes of the rest of the C&amp;C franchise, the Generals series focuses on a <a href=\"/command-conquer-generals-2/3030-37027/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-37027\">global</a> conflict in the near future in which the US, China, and fictional terrorist organization GLA (Global Liberation Army) duke it out for global supremacy. Lying somewhere between the sci-fi self-seriousness of the Tiberian games and the totally ridiculous alternate history of the Red Alert series, Generals carved out its own humorous niche as a kind of exaggerated parody of the current real world. It was the first C&amp;C game to feature an experience system, whereby the players collect points over the course of a match that can be spent on special powers and upgrades that persist for that match only. Generals is also the first full 3D Command and Conquer game, as previous ones used either sprites or voxels.</p><h3>Command &amp; Conquer: Generals</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3431/823806-generals.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-823806\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4184397163121\" data-width=\"282\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 282px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:141.8%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3431/823806-generals.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-823806\"><img alt=\"C&amp;C Generals\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 282px) 100vw, 282px\" data-width=\"282\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/3431/823806-generals.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/3431/823806-generals.jpg 282w\"><noscript><img alt=\"C&amp;C Generals\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/3431/823806-generals.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/3431/823806-generals.jpg 282w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 282px) 100vw, 282px\" data-width=\"282\"></noscript></a><figcaption>C&amp;C Generals</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/command-conquer-generals/3030-10973/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10973\">Command &amp; Conquer: Generals</a> was released in 2003 and depicts a near future war featuring allied China and USA against the terrorist organization Global Liberation Army (GLA).</p><h3>Command &amp; Conquer: Generals - Zero Hour</h3><p><a href=\"/command-conquer-generals-zero-hour/3030-17982/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17982\">Command &amp; Conquer: Generals - Zero Hour</a> is the expansion for the original <a href=\"/command-conquer-generals/3030-10973/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10973\">Command &amp; Conquer: Generals</a>, also released in 2003, and includes new campaign missions, multiplayer maps, specialized subfactions for each of the existing 3 factions, and a General's Challenge mode, in which the player faces each of the new subfactions as personified by an FMV actor who would taunt and react to the player while the player battled them.</p><h3>Command &amp; Conquer</h3><p><a href=\"/command-conquer-generals-2/3030-37027/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-37027\">Command &amp; Conquer</a> was a free-to-play sequel to Command &amp; Conquer: Generals being made by <a href=\"/victory-games/3010-4744/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-4744\">Victory Games</a>.

This is what the games are based in, with most putting the player in the shoes of an Allied commander, fighting the Soviets.<br/><br/><h3>Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/182242-redalert_screen001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-182242\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.628125\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.8%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/182242-redalert_screen001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-182242\"><img alt=\"Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/56/182242-redalert_screen001.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/56/182242-redalert_screen001.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert</figcaption></figure></h3><br/><a data-ref-id=\"3030-249\" href=\"/command-conquer-red-alert/3030-249/\" slug=\"command-conquer-red-alert\">Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert</a>, the first title in the Red Alert franchise, was developed by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-261\" href=\"/westwood-studios-inc/3010-261/\" slug=\"westwood-studios-inc\">Westwood Studios</a> and published by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-176\" href=\"/virgin-interactive-entertainment-inc/3010-176/\" slug=\"virgin-interactive-entertainment-inc\">Virgin Interactive</a>, and released on October 31, 1996.

It is a prequel to the original <a data-ref-id=\"3030-4384\" href=\"/command-conquer/3030-4384/\" slug=\"command-conquer\">Command &amp; Conquer</a>. Red Alert is a traditional real-time strategy game, and was praised for its user interface (which critics said was very well-developed). Red Alert was also one of the very first games to have competitive online play.<br/><br/>Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert had two expansion packs as well: <a data-ref-id=\"3030-11328\" href=\"/command-conquer-red-alert-counterstrike/3030-11328/\" slug=\"command-conquer-red-alert-counterstrike\">Counterstrike</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-16365\" href=\"/command-conquer-red-alert-the-aftermath/3030-16365/\" slug=\"command-conquer-red-alert-the-aftermath\">Aftermath</a>. Of note is that Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert: Counterstrike added missions in which the player battles against giant red ants, known as the secret Ant Missions. Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert: Aftermath added new units that could be used in both singleplayer and multiplayer, such as the Field Mechanic, Chrono Tank, Missile Sub, Shock Trooper, M.A.D Tank, Tesla Tank, and Demolition Truck. Hundreds of new maps were also included with the Aftermath expansion pack. Red Alert (along with both expansion packs) was released on the PlayStation on August 28, 1998 under the title <a data-ref-id=\"3030-166\" href=\"/command-conquer-red-alert-retaliation/3030-166/\" slug=\"command-conquer-red-alert-retaliation\">Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert: Retaliation</a>. <br/><br/><h3>Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 2<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8656/245742-ingame_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-245742\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8656/245742-ingame_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-245742\"><img alt=\"Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 2\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/8656/245742-ingame_01.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/8656/245742-ingame_01.jpg 800w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/8656/245742-ingame_01.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/8656/245742-ingame_01.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 2</figcaption></figure></h3><br/><a data-ref-id=\"3030-18072\" href=\"/command-conquer-red-alert-2/3030-18072/\" slug=\"command-conquer-red-alert-2\">Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 2</a> is a direct sequel to the original Red Alert. Red Alert 2 was developed by  Westwood Pacific and published by EA Games on October 23, 2000. Red Alert 2 again followed the conflict between the Soviets and Allied, and as in almost every Command &amp; Conquer game, featured two distinct plotlines (although only the Allied story is considered canon). Most actions in Red Alert 2 are based around the accumulation of ore (the game's currency), most importantly purchasing units and buildings. Red Alert 2 also featured an extensive multiplayer with both online and local LAN multiplayer.<br/><br/><h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4938/602929-untitled.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-602929\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.6609375\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.1%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4938/602929-untitled.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-602929\"><img alt=\"Yuri\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4938/602929-untitled.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/4938/602929-untitled.png 640w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4938/602929-untitled.png 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4938/602929-untitled.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Yuri\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4938/602929-untitled.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/4938/602929-untitled.png 640w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4938/602929-untitled.png 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4938/602929-untitled.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Yuri</figcaption></figure></h3><h3>Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 2: Yuri's Revenge</h3><br/>Red Alert 2 also had one expansion pack, but <a data-ref-id=\"3030-5550\" href=\"/command-conquer-red-alert-2-yuris-revenge/3030-5550/\" slug=\"command-conquer-red-alert-2-yuris-revenge\">Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 2: Yuri's Revenge</a> did more than just add maps and units. Yuri's Revenge was developed by Westwood Pacific and published by EA Games, and was released on October 10, 2001. Yuri's Revenge adds a completely new story (again with both Allied and Soviet), but this time the two factions fight for a somewhat common goal (although, naturally, motivations differ). Both factions are trying to defeat the threat of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2716\" href=\"/yuri/3005-2716/\" slug=\"yuri\">Yuri</a>, a rogue Soviet commander who has masterminded the ability of mind-control, and nearly uses it to destroy all of the free world. Again, only the Allied story is considered canon. Yuri's Revenge also featured the ability to play as Yuri in multiplayer, with many of his buildings and units being much more brutal.<br/><br/><h3>Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1840/254601-red_alert_3_announcement_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-254601\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.735625\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:73.6%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1840/254601-red_alert_3_announcement_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-254601\"><img alt=\"Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/1840/254601-red_alert_3_announcement_1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/1840/254601-red_alert_3_announcement_1.jpg 1600w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/0/1840/254601-red_alert_3_announcement_1.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/1840/254601-red_alert_3_announcement_1.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/1840/254601-red_alert_3_announcement_1.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/1840/254601-red_alert_3_announcement_1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/1840/254601-red_alert_3_announcement_1.jpg 1600w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/0/1840/254601-red_alert_3_announcement_1.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/1840/254601-red_alert_3_announcement_1.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/1840/254601-red_alert_3_announcement_1.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3</figcaption></figure></h3><br/><a data-ref-id=\"3030-20660\" href=\"/command-conquer-red-alert-3/3030-20660/\" slug=\"command-conquer-red-alert-3\">Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3</a> is the latest game in the Red Alert franchise.

It was originally released on the PC on October 28, 2008, but was later released on the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. It is due to be released on the PlayStation 3 and for Mac OS as well, later this year. Red Alert 3 further complicates the plot, this time with the Soviets discovering a way to alter the past, and thus erasing Albert Einstein from existence. Again, their plan backfires, and causes the Empire of the Rising Sun to grow to power. This causes a three-way war between the Soviets, the Allies, and the Empire of the Rising Sun. Gameplay is similar to other games in the franchise, but Red Alert 3 introduces many new things, such as water base-building, and units that can go on multiple places (e.g. a flying vehicle that can land on the water, transforming into a boat).<br/><br/><a data-ref-id=\"3030-25034\" href=\"/command-conquer-red-alert-3-uprising/3030-25034/\" slug=\"command-conquer-red-alert-3-uprising\">Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3: Uprising</a> is the expansion pack for Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3.

The player can now fire this up and down as well as left and right.\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>Humor was an important part of the series as it fit in well with the cartoony look of the graphics. <a data-ref-id=\"3040-1\" href=\"/tom-hall/3040-1/\" slug=\"tom-hall\">             Tom Hall</a> said that they took a lot of inspiration from Looney Toons and in a number of places, for instance outside the\u00a0oracles\u00a0house, you can see tributes to the \"Acme\" company from Looney Toons.\u00a0\u00a0Another example of the humor is in one instance Keen has to collect 12 1-inch worms and when he does a giant foot appears, due to 12 inches equaling one foot.\u00a0<br/>\u00a0 <br/><h2>The Standard Galactic Alphabet</h2> <p>During the course of the Keen games, the player will encounter several signs with odd symbols printed on them. This is in fact The Standard Galactic Alphabet (SGA), which serves as the alien language in the series.<br/> <br/> </p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3042/1418513-sgahi.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1418513\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.0689655172414\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:106.9%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3042/1418513-sgahi.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1418513\"><img alt=\"\u00a0\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0\"Hi\" written in SGA letters</figcaption></figure> <p>The SGA was created by <a data-ref-id=\"3040-1\" href=\"/tom-hall/3040-1/\" slug=\"tom-hall\">                   Tom Hall</a>.
