Originally developed for the <a href=\"/bbc-micro/3045-110/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-110\">BBC Micro</a> the Elite series gained a cult following and high reputation for it's pioneering open ended gameplay, procedurally generated game world and 3D graphics. It's been seen as highly influential in the genre and helping inspire games like <a href=\"/freelancer/3030-5565/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5565\">Freelancer</a>, <a href=\"/x/3025-2786/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-2786\">the X series</a>, <a href=\"/wing-commander-privateer/3030-15239/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15239\">Wing Commander: Privateer</a> and <a href=\"/eve/3025-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1455\">Eve Online</a>.</p><h2>History</h2><h3><a href=\"/elite/3030-10902/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10902\">Elite</a></h3><p>Launched in 1984 the original Elite offered a remarkable array of gameplay and exploration despite the technical limitation of the BBC Micro. Players could trade, mine and dogfight within military and bounty hunting settings. Most revolutionary was the game world itself. Due to the lack of power in the BBC Micro the game-world was procedurally generated ensuring unique game worlds. This added a layer of exploration which was extremely limited in gaming at the time. The game also was among the first to use 3D graphics. Whilst wireframe and basic this helped cement Elite's reputation not only as a great game but as a technical showcase.</p><p>Conversions to other platforms immediately followed, fairly soon Elite was available on most systems; C64, Amiga etc. Many different version has unique additions such as extra missions.</p><h3><a href=\"/frontier-elite-ii/3030-16330/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16330\">Frontier: Elite 2</a></h3><p>The sequel to the seminal Elite launched in 1993 for the Commodore Amiga and was attributed only to David Braben. Published by Konami the game kept much of the same gameplay of it's predecessor whilst fleshing out the game world. You could now travel within planetary systems and land on planets and were no longer restricted to one ship. The procedurally generated universe had expanded in scope also. Planet size was now estimated accurately and it was claimed that the universes created were realistic enough to recreate real life phenomena such as black holes and supermassive stars. The most divisive change was in ship handling. The game changed from arcade to real newtonian physics with the ship flying closer to resembling that of a basic flight sim than the arcade dog fighter that it followed. This allowed for more \"real world\" features with the physics model allowing for planetary slingshots for experienced players. This divided fans and critics with some seeing this as moving away from the legacy left by Elite and making the game a slower and less action packed game. Nonetheless the game was popular and spawned a sequel.</p><p> </p><h3><a href=\"/frontier-first-encounters/3030-4432/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4432\">Frontier: First Encounters</a></h3><p>Released early under heavy pressure from publishers GameTek Frontier: First Encounters was riddled with bugs and half finished. The most commonly cited bug is that of an auto pilot that will crash automatically when used. The game had aimed to build on the now established space trading/open world staples of the series with a story fleshed out by in game journals. However the critical response was dominated by the amount of game breaking bugs. David Braben eventually took GameTek to court for the botched launch and settled out of court. The game has subsequently been patched and with fan mods now has a modest reputation in the fan community.</p><h3><a href=\"/elite-dangerous/3030-40419/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-40419\">Elite: Dangerous</a></h3><p>After being in and out of development several times the fourth title in the Elite series appeared as a Kickstarter at the end of 2012. Promising the choice of offline and MMO style play, high customisation and the traditional huge game world to explore Elite: Dangerous achieved it's goal and raised over \u00a31.5 million in crowdsourced funding.

The games are like digital novels and involve reading a story that contains multiple endings which are reached after making simple choices, similar to a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure\" data-target=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Choose Your Own Adventure</a> book.</p><p>In terms of presentation, Chunsoft's sound novels have the story's text cover the entire screen, instead of being inside a textbox, and usually have an image behind the text showing what is being described. The games also place a heavy reliance on sound design, hence the franchise's name, with sound effects and music being used to create the titles' atmosphere. The visuals of Chunsoft's early sound novels were often minimalist in style, such as <a href=\"/banshee-s-last-cry/3030-28241/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-28241\">Kamaitachi no Yoru</a> which represented its characters as blue silhouettes.

With this goal in mind and Nakamura wanting to work on a smaller project, it was decided to adapt the fun of reading a novel into a video game format on the <a href=\"/super-nintendo-entertainment-system/3045-9/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\">Super Famicom</a> [1]. The idea was to take advantage of the platform's advanced stereo sound chip to add atmosphere to the story while making the text itself more readable by using the Super Famicom's ability to render <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji\" data-target=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">kainji</a> characters, which had previously been impossible on the <a href=\"/nintendo-entertainment-system/3045-21/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-21\">Famicom</a> [2][4]. Originally the presentation of Chunsoft's first sound novel, Otogirisou, was just going to be text on top of a graphic of a textured book page with the focus purely being on the story and audio experience. However, after concerns were issued about its presentation, Chunsoft decided to have different background graphics appear behind the text based on what was being described in the story [2]. This would cement the presentation style used in all of Chunsoft's future sound novel titles.</p><h2>Influence</h2><p>Chunsoft's sound novel series started out modestly with <a href=\"/otogirisou/3030-30224/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-30224\">Otogirisou</a> steadily selling over time due to positive word of mouth [2]. However, the franchise soon exploded with mainstream popularity when <a href=\"/banshee-s-last-cry/3030-28241/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-28241\">Kamaitachi no Yoru</a> released in 1994, which would go on to sell 700,000 copies on the Super Famicom alone [2][4]. Kamaitachi no Yoru was responsible for popularizing novel-style video games in Japan and would go on to serve as the progenitor to what the West knows as the <a href=\"/visual-novel/3015-2029/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2029\">visual novel</a> genre, directly influencing the <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/leaf-visual-novel-series/3025-4357/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-4357\">Leaf Visual Novel Series</a> which coined the term [3].</p><p>The term \"<a href=\"/sound-novel/3015-9258/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-9258\">sound novel</a>\" is trademarked by Chunsoft but, despite this, fans often treat the term as a genre title and use it to classify games made by other developers that are similar to Chunsoft's. One of the earliest instances of a company mimicking Chunsoft's Sound Novel franchise is <a href=\"/athena-co-ltd/3010-3322/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-3322\">Athena</a>'s <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/yakouchuu/3030-37949/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-37949\">Yakochu</a> for the <a href=\"/super-nintendo-entertainment-system/3045-9/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\">Super Famicom</a> which was released only a few months after Kamaitachi no Yoru in 1995. Examples of non-Chunsoft sound novels that are more well known in the West include titles such as the <a href=\"/when-they-cry/3025-4431/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-4431\">When They Cry</a> titles developed by <a href=\"/07th-expansion/3010-7561/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-7561\">07th Expansion</a>, which label themselves as a sound novels, and <a href=\"/chrono-trigger/3030-9249/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9249\">Chrono Trigger</a>'s <a href=\"/satellaview/3045-98/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-98\">Satellaview</a> exclusive sequel, <a href=\"/radical-dreamers-nusumenai-houseki/3030-11566/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11566\">Radical Dreamers</a>.</p><h2>External Links</h2><ol><li><a href=\"http://shmuplations.com/whatisgamedesign/\" rel=\"nofollow \">What is Game Design?
