The story takes place over two generations and across many lands, including Daventry, Kolyma, Llewdor, Tamir, Serenia, Eldritch, Etheria and the Land of the Green Isles. \u00a0The series spans a total of 8 games across 14 years, starting in 1984 with King\u2019s Quest: Quest for the crown to the release of King's Quest: Mask of Eternity in 1998. There have also been numerous re-releases and collections, most notably the original game, which had a total of 10 re-releases.\u00a0\u00a0<br/><br/> The main characters in the series are Sir (later King) Graham and members of his family: his wife, Valanice, and his twin son and daughter, Alexander and Rosella. The exception is KQ VIII, where the protagonist is Connor, a tanner in the Kingdom of Daventry who is unrelated to the royal family. Because of this and the emphasis on RPG and action elements in KQ VIII, many fans refuse to consider it a true sequel and call it KQ:MOE (for Mask of Eternity, the game's subtitle).\u00a0<br/><br/> Many famous fictional characters make appearances in the series, including Beauty and the Beast, Rumplestiltskin, Red Riding Hood and Count Dracula. They are featured most prominently in the earlier games, which focus on solving item-based puzzles in a fantasy setting. The later sequels have more elaborate story lines, more complicated puzzles, and more original and realistic characters.\u00a0<br/><br/><h2>Overall Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2238/372713-kq5_ami_5.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-372713\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.625\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2238/372713-kq5_ami_5.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-372713\"><img alt=\"\u00a0Take anything not nailed down.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/2238/372713-kq5_ami_5.gif\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/2238/372713-kq5_ami_5.gif 640w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/2238/372713-kq5_ami_5.gif 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0Take anything not nailed down.</figcaption></figure>     Beginning with the original game and used until the fifth game in the series, the player's interaction with the game consisted entirely of typing commands into the game's parser, then reading the parser's response. \u00a0As the first adventure game to integrate graphical animation into the player's view of game world, King's Quest shifted the focus away from the static scenery, to the player's character, which was now animated on-screen. As the player used the keyboard to explore the game world, the on-screen character, King Graham, was animated walking to the chosen destination. There were animation sequences for most player-world interactions reachable through the normal course of exploration. For example, there were different animation sequences showing King Graham picking up objects from the ground, opening doors, and wading through water. Depth perspective was simulated as well; Graham could walk behind objects, causing his character to be 'hidden' from view, or walk in front of them, obscuring the object. This attention to graphical animation, while commonplace in arcade-action games, earned King's Quest the distinction as the first \"3D-animated\" adventure game.\u00a0<br/><br/> King\u2019s Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder was the first King's Quest game to replace the typing user interface with a point-and-click user interface. Instead of typing commands, players used a series of icons to navigate the game. \u00a0Most often throughout the series, as with other adventure games, these icons included \u201cwalk\u201d as a character icon, \u201ctalk\u201d as a mouth, \u201clook\u201d as an eye, \u00a0and \u201cuse\u201d as a hand.\u00a0<br/><br/> All games in the series, with the exception of King's Quest: Mask of Eternity, used the standard adventure game paradigm by presenting the player with puzzles they must solve with items from their inventory. \u00a0The last game in the series departed from traditional methods and instead went to full 3D and used more of the current, at the time, RPG methods of play \u2013 including combat.\u00a0<br/><br/><h2>Notable Development History</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15568/627468-box_kq1_sci.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-627468\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.27\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:127.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15568/627468-box_kq1_sci.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-627468\"><img alt=\"\u00a0The start of a series\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/15568/627468-box_kq1_sci.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/15568/627468-box_kq1_sci.jpg 500w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/15568/627468-box_kq1_sci.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"\u00a0The start of a series\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/15568/627468-box_kq1_sci.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/15568/627468-box_kq1_sci.jpg 500w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/15568/627468-box_kq1_sci.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0The start of a series</figcaption></figure> <h3>King\u2019s Quest I</h3> Released in 1983 by IBM as a demonstration product for their IBM PCjr, King's Quest I is not only the first \"animated\" adventure game, it was also the first Sierra game to use the AGI engine. (However, the AGI engine wasn't known as such until King's Quest II.) Since the IBM PCjr didn't sell particularly well, the game was later released directly by Sierra for IBM PCs in addition to other platforms such as the Amiga, Atari ST and Sega Master System.\u00a0\u00a0<br/><br/> King's Quest I was innovative in its use of 16-color graphics on the PCjr and Tandy 1000; even CGA owners could enjoy 16-color graphics if they used a composite monitor or TV. The level of interaction with the graphics was an enormous leap over the mostly un-animated \"rooms\" of previous graphical interactive fiction.\u00a0<br/><br/><h3>King\u2019s Quest: Mask of Eternity\u00a0</h3> Although not described as KQ8 in the released game (other than being described as the eighth title in the series on a sticker placed on shrink wrap), a folder in the King's Quest Collection 2 contained a preview video for the game that was entitled, KQ8AVI.\u00a0<br/><br/> Roberta Williams had said in interviews at the time that she no longer liked the idea of roman numerals or numbers designating sequels and wanted to distance the later sequels in the series from the use of them. She gave several reasons for her choice to remove the numbers, one being that numbers might give a bad impression to the fans that might think that the sequel wasn't nearly as good as the games coming before it, as is often the case with sequels to movies.\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/><h2>Notable Locations\u00a0</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13157/1333497-worlddaventry.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1333497\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.63375\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:63.4%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13157/1333497-worlddaventry.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1333497\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/13157/1333497-worlddaventry.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/13157/1333497-worlddaventry.jpg 800w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/13157/1333497-worlddaventry.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/13157/1333497-worlddaventry.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/13157/1333497-worlddaventry.jpg 800w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/13157/1333497-worlddaventry.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a></figure> <h3>Daventry</h3> Daventry can refer to several things: Properly, it's the name of the Kingdom of Daventry, but the name can be also used to refer to the world in which the King's Quest games take place, the World of Daventry. The name can also refer to Castle Daventry, the great keep and seat of power for the Kingdom of Daventry, and Daventry town ( which is not far from from the castle), and in some cases it is an alternate title for the continent of Serenia.\u00a0<br/><br/> According to the King's Quest Companion; \"World of Daventry\" or simply \"Daventry\" is a name humans may use for the entire world where King's Quest's lands are located, although this is not the proper name of the planet. The world appears to actually be earth from a long time ago in the distant past, and like the present earth shares the solar system with at least Jupiter. At several points in history magical beings withdrew into Daventry to avoid persecution by the increasingly scientific societies. The world is continued to be called \"Earth\" by the gnomes from the Underground Realm of the Gnomes, and the occasional human (according to the games and manuals).<br/> <br/> The Kingdom of Daventry, aka the realm of Daventry, is main Daventry on the continent of Daventry/Serenia. It is the home of Royal Family of Daventry, King Graham, Queen Valanice and their two children. Daventry is a very old kingdom and had its share of good and bad kings over the thousands of years of its existence. \u00a0Daventry is the greatest kingdom on the continent, and there is a great deal of evidence to support his belief. The Town of Daventry and Connor's Village are located not far from the castle.\u00a0<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13157/1333493-kolymaland.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1333493\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.92592592592593\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:92.6%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13157/1333493-kolymaland.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1333493\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/13157/1333493-kolymaland.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/13157/1333493-kolymaland.jpg 648w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/13157/1333493-kolymaland.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/13157/1333493-kolymaland.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/13157/1333493-kolymaland.jpg 648w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/13157/1333493-kolymaland.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a></figure> <h3>Kolyma</h3> The map of World of Daventry in King's Quest Companion shows its location as being southeast of the kingdom of Daventry and directly south of Land of the Green Isles in the Southern Sea The western side of Kolyma folds back upon itself to both the north and south, forever bringing travelers back to where they started. Geographers say that the \"magical law of \"containment\" operates in the western part of the continent. For reasons forgotten, or perhaps it was whimsy on the part of the multiverse--movement to both the north and south in this part of Kolyma eventually turned back upon itself, contained as if inside some transparent cosmic donut. East and west, one could travel at will until confronted by more physical barriers--the sea or mountains for instance--but those that journeyed far enough north of south, would always get back to where they started.\u00a0\u00a0<br/><br/> There are mentions that vampires hunt this land at night, with ghouls and ghosts as their grim companions. They rule the dark from the castle on the island in the middle of a poisonous lake. The Monks will shelter the occasional traveler to protect them from the undead. Because of the danger of the undead most folk live on the eastern shores of Kolyma beyond the chasm and the mountain. With the only passage between the mountains being the Magical Doorway which will send people elsewhere if they don't have the proper key. The western shore is guarded by the King of the Sea. These various barriers have, with only occasional exceptions kept the Children of the Night Isolated.\u00a0<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13157/1333494-llewdorland.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1333494\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.90634441087613\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:90.6%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13157/1333494-llewdorland.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1333494\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/13157/1333494-llewdorland.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/13157/1333494-llewdorland.jpg 662w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/13157/1333494-llewdorland.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/13157/1333494-llewdorland.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/13157/1333494-llewdorland.jpg 662w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/13157/1333494-llewdorland.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a></figure> <h3>Llewdor</h3> It is one of the two main kingdoms on the continent of Tanalore, along with Tamir. It was the land where Gwydion was forced to be a slave to the wizard Manannan. The main city in Llewdor is known as Port Bruce, and it includes a bar/pub/restaurant, a general store, and a dock. Bandits reside in Llewdor, as does Medusa in the desert to the west, and the Three Bears. It is here that Gwydion partially discovers who he is and is captured by pirates on his way home to Daventry. Sir David of Bruce came from this land.\u00a0\u00a0<br/><br/> The Magical Law of \"Containment\" occurs in the land, causing the north and south to bend back upon itself, so that anyone traveling north, will end up coming up from the south, or vice versa.<br/> <br/><h3>Tamir</h3> Tamir was a land visited during King's Quest IV: The Perils of Rosella. It is one of the two main kingdoms on the continent of Tanalore along with Llewdor. Tamir was the land that was cared for by the fairy Genesta. Unfortunately the evil fairy, Lolotte, wanted to be ruler of the land. That land also housed a magic fruit that would heal the sick.<br/> The land is comprised of beach, meadowlands, forest, Scary Woods, Impossible Mountains, and the Death Bogs of Tamir. The seven Dwarfs, Cupid, Pan, and Edgar also resided there.\u00a0<br/><br/> The Magical Law of \"Containment\" occurs in the land, causing the north and south to bend back upon itself, so that anyone traveling north, will end up coming up from the south, or vice versa.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13157/1333496-serenialand.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1333496\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.91590214067278\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:91.6%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13157/1333496-serenialand.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1333496\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/13157/1333496-serenialand.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/13157/1333496-serenialand.png 654w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/13157/1333496-serenialand.png 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/13157/1333496-serenialand.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/13157/1333496-serenialand.png 654w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/13157/1333496-serenialand.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a></figure> <h3>Serenia</h3> Serenia is the is name of the continent where the Sovereignty of Serenia, Kingdom of Daventry and several other smaller nations are located. The continent is also known as Daventry, as for a time that kingdom was only land on the continent as the northern Serenia had mysteriously vanished (but later reappeared around 24 GC). Other Continents in the world include Kolyma and Tanalore, and an unnamed continent north of Serenia, where Harlin's castle was located. Serenia can also refer to Serenia towne and the Village of Serenia.\u00a0<br/><br/> This land first appeared in The Wizard and the Princess and Adventure in Serenia, and was later revisited in King's Quest V.<br/> <br/> The continent was originally called Daventry in King's Quest Companion, First Edition, and King's Quest 3. As shown in the book and game during the era's of King's Quest 1-4, the Sovereignty of Serenia was missing. The KQ3 Charts, 1st Edition Maps and Alexander's account of his escape from Manannan show that Serenia was missing at the time (and the continent was referred to as Daventry). In the Second Edition, Serenia reappeared, and the book uses the name Daventry and Serenia interchangeably for the name of the continent. The continent is referred to as Daventry in the An Encyclopedia of Daventry in the 2nd Edition. The 2nd Edition Maps and 3rd Edition Maps show the continent being referred to as Daventry as well.<br/> <br/><h3>Eldritch</h3> The Realm of Eldritch is a magical realm, filled with many mythical and powerful people and beings. As said above, Eldritch is a land of magic and almost everyone who lives there knows magic or is of magic. Many of the residents of Eldritch, particularly those in Etheria, the capital of Eldritch, are Fairies who are primordial beings and gods and goddesses. Other citizens of Etheria include spirits of the land and air. Eldritch is ruled by the king and queen, Oberon and Titania, who also are the king and queen of Fairies. Eldritch consists of the Vulcanix Underground, Ooga Booga, Bountiful Woods, Were-Woods, Etheria, Nonsense Land and Falderal.<br/> <br/><br/><h3>Etheria \u00a0</h3> Etheria also known as the Faerieland or the Land in the Clouds[1] is a heavenly realm above Eldritch, the capital of that land, and is the home of fairies, ruled by Titania and Oberon. Etheria is a land set upon the clouds, and some of the deities and powers of the world of Daventry continent reside in Etheria, along with other mystical and magical people and beings.<br/> Etheria is a land of clouds, rainbows, beauty and sweet song, and one of its greatest places is its amazing city of the same name. Time moves faster in Etheria than it does in Daventry.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13157/1333492-greenislesland.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1333492\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.91324200913242\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:91.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13157/1333492-greenislesland.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1333492\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/13157/1333492-greenislesland.gif\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/13157/1333492-greenislesland.gif 657w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/13157/1333492-greenislesland.gif 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/13157/1333492-greenislesland.gif\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/13157/1333492-greenislesland.gif 657w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/13157/1333492-greenislesland.gif 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a></figure> <h3>Land of the Green Isles. \u00a0</h3> The Land of the Green Isles is the name for a land and kingdom comprised of a chain of islands (though not all islands of the chain are part of the kingdom).\u00a0<br/><br/> An ancient and peaceful kingdom, the Land of the Green Isles has long been the subject of much debate as to whether the land is a reality or if it is just a work of a great imagination. Until recently, the land was largely dismissed as being myth. The Land consists of four main islands; the Isle of the Crown (the island from which the king and queen rule), the Isle of Wonder, the Isle of the Sacred Mountain, and the Isle of the Beast (formerly the Isle of the Forest).\u00a0<br/><br/> A fifth island sometimes stays around long enough to be counted as a semi-permanent member of the insular community, the Isle of the Mists. It is visible and visitable only when the Druids can cast and maintain an earth spell to blow away the island's eternal fog.\u00a0<br/><br/><h2>Mythology</h2> Much of King's Quest was inspired by fairy tales, which designer Roberta Williams loved reading. Many creatures, characters and situations from mythology, fairy tales, and folklore are encountered within the world of King's Quest. A Minotaur, Pan, Pandora, Charon, Cupid, Ceres, Druids, Harpies, Oracles, Neptune, Medusa, The Fates and the Graeae appear in various games in the series. In general, the mythology of the King's Quest world is derived from that of the Ancient Greeks, Romans, and Celts.\u00a0<br/><br/> Magic plays a large role in the King's Quest series. Wizards, witches, enchanters, sorcerers, and genies appear throughout. In some of the games (most prominently in KQIII), the main character must use magic spells or items to achieve a goal.\u00a0<br/><br/><h2>Official King\u2019s Quest Timeline</h2> KQ1 is designated as the year 0 GC date. GC (Graham's Coronation) is an unofficial designation for what is the equivalent to KQ1. These are derived only from official sources, with KQ1 designated as the starting date. Later timelines are inconsistent with the official timeline, and dates are off by a couple years.\u00a0<br/><br/> Official sources may not always be consistent. For example; The introductory story in KQ2 manual originally implied that events of KQ2 took place one year after KQ1, according to the KQ4 manual he saw Valanice in the magic mirror and left on the adventure three years after KQ1, the KQV Hintbook placed the events of KQ2 several years after KQ1 (implying it was more than three years).\u00a0<br/><br/> The KQV Hintbook has other discrepencies. According to KQ4 the royal twins were born two years after KQ2, which is supported by age of twins given in later sources in relation to dates given in those sources (KQ6 Hintbook, King's Quest Companion, KQ7, etc). The KQV hintbook states that the birth of the twins was one year after the events of KQ2 (which doesn't fit with other references). King's Quest Companion states that Alexander was kidnapped by shores of Lake Maylie during a summer picnic. The KQV Hintbook places the kidnapping in the castle nursery. KQV Hintbook also contains a possible discrepency for when Alexander was kidnapped by Manannan. It states that he was kidnapped exactly six months after his birth. However creates problems with other known details in relation to other sources; Alexander's was a few weeks from his eighteenth birthday, the story took place during late summer, and that See No Weevil places the twins birthdays in early autumn. If Alexander was born during early Autumnn, as per See No Weevil and supported by KQ3, and kidnapped during the summer (according to King's Quest Companion), then it would imply that Alexander could have been kidnapped up to nine months after his birth. King's Quest Hintbook's six month date (from autumn birthdate) would place his kidnapping in during late winter, early spring. The KQV Hintbook also places the events of KQ1 during the spring, but it is unclear what affects, if any, that would have on the timeline.", "guid": "3025-413", "name": "King's Quest"}, {"description": "<h2>Overview</h2><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-198387\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/112/198387-kh_006.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/112/198387-kh_006.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-198387\"><img alt=\"Kingdom Hearts combat gameplay\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/112/198387-kh_006.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/112/198387-kh_006.jpg 640w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/112/198387-kh_006.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/112/198387-kh_006.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Kingdom Hearts combat gameplay</figcaption></figure><p>The Kingdom Hearts franchise is the product of studio cooperation between <a href=\"/final-fantasy/3025-194/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-194\">Final Fantasy</a> producer <a href=\"/square-enix/3010-104/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-104\">Square Enix</a> (formerly <a href=\"/square-company-ltd/3010-6323/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6323\">Squaresoft</a>), and <a href=\"/disney-interactive-studios/3010-3297/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-3297\">Disney Interactive Studios</a>.

People thought that light came from Kingdom Hearts. Kingdom Hearts contained the hearts of all worlds. It was guarded by the \u03c7-Blade. Those who seeked Kingdom Hearts created darkness. The warriors who seeked Kingdom Hearts made replicas of the \u03c7-Blade called keyblades. This led to the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/keyblade-war/3015-7688/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7688\">Keyblade War</a>. The clash shattered the \u03c7-Blade into twenty pieces: 7 of light and 13 of darkness. Without the \u03c7-Blade, Kingdom Hearts was swallowed by darkness. Over the many years later, a young man named Xehanort lived at Destiny Islands and claimed this world is too small. He was greeted by his heart to grab 12 incarnations of him via time travel. Xehanort returned to the present and found a way out of the Islands. He went to the Land of Departure to become a Keyblade Master. Over the years, Xehanort was learning about what happened in the past, including the Keyblade War. He has conflicts with his classmate and fellow Keyblade Master <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/eraqus/3005-13333/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-13333\">Eraqus</a>. Xehanort decided to find a vessel suitable for him to forge the \u03c7-Blade. Xehanort found a teenager named <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/ventus/3005-3348/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3348\">Ventus</a> and let him use his darkness but the failure let to Ventus' darkness extraction and made into a human named Vanitas. Xehanort returned to his hometown and let Ventus rest. Ventus was greeted by a newborn's heart and heals him. Xehanort took Ventus to train with his former classmate, Eraqus. Ventus met his classmates, Aqua and Terra but Ventus can't remember what happened to him. Terra and Aqua participated in the Mark of Mastery exam. The result was that Aqua became a keyblade master. Xehanort wanted to let Terra be his new vessel to live a longer life. Xehanort allied with a man named Braig to become another vessel. At Radiant Garden, Aqua met a girl who touched her keyblade. This made the girl wield a keyblade. After teaming up with Mickey Mouse, Aqua talked to Kairi and cast a magic spell. At Destiny Islands, Terra met Riku and let Riku become a keyblade wielder. Xehanort told Ventus some of his lost memories to forge the \u03c7-Blade. At the Keyblade Graveyard, Vanitas revealed to Ventus that he created the Unversed. Vanitas fused with Ventus to recreate the \u03c7-Blade. Xehanort stabbed himself with his Keyblade and aimed his heart at Terra. Xehanort is now inside Terra's body and heart but his mind resisted and it lives in his armor. The \u03c7-Blade was later broken by Aqua. Xehanort lost his memories after the battle. At the Land of Departure, Aqua put Ven's body in the Chamber of Waking. This resluted in the destroyed land becoming Castle Oblivion. Xehanort wondered who he was at Radiant Garden. Xehanort was plunged into darkness after he stabbed himself with his Keyblade to get rid of Terra inside him. Aqua sent him and her armor and keyblade to the light and survived in the darkness for 11 years. Xehanort was met by a teacher named Ansem. His old ally, Braig helped him remember again. Ven's heart was sent to the same kid who healed him. The kid's name was Sora. Xehanort created experiments until Ansem forbid them. He and his allies worked on more inventions without Ansem's permission. Xehanort took Ansem's name and sent him to the Realm of Darkness. Xehanort remembered and stabbed Braig with his keyblade which resulted into Braig's Nobody born. Xehanort and his other apprentices became Heartless and Nobodies. Over the next 9 years, Xehanort's Heartless, Ansem ravaged multiple worlds with darkness and expanded Kingdom Hearts. Xehanort's nobody, Xemnas created Organization XIII to find Xehanort's heart and divide it into 13. Xemnas made a Kingdom Hearts that is filled with the hearts of men so he can transfer Xehanort's heart to the Organization. During the same time, a horrible storm caused by the Heartless ravages Destiny Islands. Sora is separated from his friends Tidus, Wakka, Selphie, and more importantly Riku and Kairi. After mysteriously receiving the keyblade and battling a giant heartless, he wakes up in Traverse Town where he meets Donald Duck and Goofy. The two of them are on a quest to find their King (King Mickey) and the three soon become friends and search for Riku and Kairi, and King Mickey respectively.</p><p>After a while, Riku is manipulated by Xehanort's ally <a href=\"/maleficent/3005-4829/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4829\">Maleficent</a> and begins to believe Sora to have forgotten all about him, as he begins his quest to single handedly get the Seven Princesses of Heart and Kairi's (whose heart was purged by the heartless) hearts back. He was eventually possessed by \"<a href=\"/ansem/3005-1361/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1361\">Ansem</a>\" and is sent to the realm of Darkness because he was about to make Riku the thirteenth vessel. When Sora stabbed himself with Ansem's keyblade, his nobody Roxas was born. Roxas became the 13th member of Organiation XIII. Like Sora and his look-alike, Ventus, he used his keyblade to defeat Heartless to find Xehanort's heart. Sora was later greeted by a <a href=\"/xemnas/3005-1359/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1359\">hooded man</a>. Six days later at the realm of darkness, the hooded man said to Roxas, \"He (Sora) looks a lot like you.\" Sora opens the door to Kingdom Hearts (which Ansem says it was filled with darkness). Upon its opening, light from the interior of Kingdom Hearts, which destroys Ansem. Sora enters, only to find King Mickey and Riku. Riku decides to travel with King Mickey, and King Mickey and Sora use their keyblades to lock the door to Kingdom Hearts. As the door is locked and all the worlds lost to the heartless are reconstruct, Sora vows to save Kairi (who restored her heart). A new fourteenth member of the Organization named <a href=\"/xion/3005-10874/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-10874\">Xion</a> appeared.

Meanwhile, Riku meets a mysterious character named \"DiZ\", and also battles a replica of himself created by Organization XIII. He finally learns that he needs no light, and that he needs to find a balance between the light and dark inside himself. Roxas at the World That Never Was decided to quit the Organization XIII. He battled Riku to avenge Xion and got sent to a digital copy of Twilight Town.</p><p>Roxas searches the mysterious mansion outside of Digital Twilight Town only to find a sleeping Sora.

Quake titles are split between science fiction and dark fantasy settings. Three of the Quake games (Quake II, Quake 4, and Enemy Territory: Quake Wars) revolve around the cyborg race called the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1387\" href=\"/the-strogg/3015-1387/\" slug=\"the-strogg\">Strogg,</a> who battle with humanity for control of Earth and its resources. The original Quake is set in a dark, medieval style fantasy world. The monsters in this world have opened a portal to earth (using earth's own \"slipgate\" teleportation technology) and wish to destroy earth. These monsters fit the dark fantasy theme as they include chainsaw-wielding ogres, knights, and an assortment of strange monsters such as the shambler. All of the Quake games have featured fast-paced arena shooter combat in multiplayer, the first iteration of the series helping to start the modern competitive gaming scene.</p><p>The series is famous for its destructive weaponry, with many iconic iterations of the <a data-ref-id=\"3055-211\" href=\"/rocket-launcher/3055-211/\" slug=\"rocket-launcher\">rocket launcher</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3055-25\" href=\"/railgun/3055-25/\" slug=\"railgun\">railgun</a>.

Puyo Puyo was originally a spinoff of the <a href=\"/madou-monogatari/3025-2444/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-2444\">Madou Monogatari</a> series, but eclipsed its home series in popularity. The first games were developed by <a href=\"/compile/3010-911/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-911\">Compile</a>; <a href=\"/sega/3010-62/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-62\">Sega</a> published the arcade versions and ports released on their platforms, while <a href=\"/banpresto-co-ltd/3010-146/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-146\">Banpresto</a> published the SNES ports and spinoffs.</p><p>During a 1998 restructure of Compile, Sega gained the character rights to the series.

Connecting four Puyo of the same color together (they can be connected horizontally or vertically and do not have to be in a straight line) will cause them to \"pop.\" As Puyo are eliminated, gray \"Nuisance\" Puyo are sent to the top of the opponent's field and will drop after the opponent has finished positioning their currently-controlled pair of Puyo. Nuisance Puyo can only be eliminated by clearing a set of adjacent color Puyo.</p><p>A player loses whenever their third column from the left is filled. In Puyo Pop Fever, Fever 2, and 7, filling the fourth column from the left will also result in defeat.</p><h2>History</h2><h3>Compile (Madou Era)</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/16207/2348838-puyo_localizations.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2348838\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.2503242542153\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:25.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/16207/2348838-puyo_localizations.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2348838\"><img alt=\"From left: Puyo Puyo (English arcade), Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, Kirby's Avalanche \" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/16207/2348838-puyo_localizations.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/16207/2348838-puyo_localizations.jpg 771w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/16207/2348838-puyo_localizations.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/16207/2348838-puyo_localizations.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>From left: Puyo Puyo (English arcade), Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, Kirby's Avalanche </figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/puyo-puyo/3030-41081/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-41081\">The very first game in the series</a>, released for the Famicom Disk System and MSX, was a simple single-player puzzle game with an optional competitive mode. The much more famous <a href=\"/puyo-puyo/3030-1916/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1916\">arcade game of the same name</a> exclusively emphasizes the competitive aspects that the series would later be known for; this version was ported to the SNES, Genesis, and Game Boy, among other platforms. Sega had the Genesis and Game Gear ports reskinned with characters from the <i>Adventures of</i> <i>Sonic the Hedgehog</i> cartoon and released the resulting game, <a href=\"/dr-robotniks-mean-bean-machine/3030-11442/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11442\">Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine</a>, in the US and Europe. Nintendo followed suit with <a href=\"/kirbys-avalanche/3030-14873/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14873\">Kirby's Avalanche</a>, which replaced the Madou Monogatari cast with <a href=\"/kirby/3025-420/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-420\">Kirby</a> characters.</p><p>Puyo Puyo's sequel, <a href=\"/puyo-puyo-2/3030-4929/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4929\">Puyo Puyo Tsu</a>, added a simple mechanic that would drastically alter the way that the game was played: the ability to reduce or eliminate waiting Nuisance Puyo. Tsu's Compile-developed sequels, <a href=\"/puyo-puyo-sun/3030-10242/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10242\">Puyo Puyo SUN</a> and <a href=\"/puyo-puyon/3030-13543/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13543\">Puyo Puyo~n</a>, add new (one-off) gimmicks to the \"Tsu Rule\"; Sun Puyo that grant bonuses in the former and character-specific powers in the latter.</p><h3>Sega (Fever Era)</h3><p><a href=\"/puyo-pop-fever/3030-7226/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7226\">Puyo Pop Fever</a> was the first main series game to be developed by Sonic Team. The new Fever Mode, activated by offsetting Nuisance Puyo before it can be dropped onto the field, generates several nearly-complete chains that can be used to turn the tide of battle. Additionally, the entire cast of characters, save Madou Monogatari protagonist <a href=\"/arle-nadja/3005-14463/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14463\">Arle Nadja</a> and series mascot <a href=\"/carbuncle/3005-719/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-719\">Carbuncle</a>, is replaced by newcomers. The game received a <a href=\"/puyo-puyo-fever-2/3030-11593/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11593\">direct sequel</a> that adds new characters but doesn't change Fever's core mechanics.

Depending on the player's choice at the beginning of a match, filling the Transformation Gauge will either cause giant Puyo, (which are easier to match up) or mini Puyo (which drop in preset chains like Fever Mode) to enter the field for a short while. The game's roster of characters consists of a handful of new characters, along with a mix of Madou Monogatari and Puyo Pop Fever characters.</p><p>In addition, two Anniversary games were released: <a href=\"/puyo-puyo-15th-anniversary/3030-23063/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-23063\">15th Anniversary</a> (before Puyo Puyo 7), and <a href=\"/puyo-puyo-20th-anniversary/3030-36900/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-36900\">20th Anniversary</a> (after 7). These games feature a mix of characters from each Puyo Puyo \"era\" and, in addition to featuring the rulesets of the original Puyo Puyo, Tsu, SUN, and Fever, offer several different gimmick modes and four-player capability.</p><h2>International Releases</h2><p>Out of the more than two dozen Puyo Puyo games, only four have (definitely) seen an official release outside of Japan. Puyo Puyo Tsu was released twice in the US and Europe: first as the Neo Geo Pocket/Color Puyo Pop, and later (untranslated) as Puyo Puyo 2 on the Wii Virtual Console. Minna de Puyo Puyo, a Game Boy Advance spinoff that was Sonic Team's first Puyo Puyo game, was localized as the GBA Puyo Pop. The N-Gage Puyo Pop was created specifically for the Western market. Finally, many versions of Puyo Pop Fever were translated and released internationally.</p><p>There are at least two English versions of the original (arcade-based) Puyo Puyo. The first is a directly-translated version of the System C2 game; it was released in Europe. However, there is little to no official proof indicating that Compile and/or Sega localized the title, which has led to claims that this release is an unlicensed bootleg. The second English version is Puzlow Kids, which is accessed by playing the Game Gear port of Puyo Puyo in an American or European handheld. According to the \"All About Puyo Puyo Tsu\" guide book, Compile was also planning a direct translation of Super Puyo Puyo before they were approached by Nintendo to make a Kirby-based game.</p>", "guid": "3025-427", "name": "Puyo Puyo"}, {"description": "<p>Punch-Out!! is a series of boxing video games from <a data-ref-id=\"3010-90\" href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\">Nintendo</a>.

It takes place in between the original The Sands of Time game and its sequel, Warrior Within. The Forgotten Sands was widely regarded as a cash-in; the Prince of Persia movie was based on the Sands of Time trilogy, but the most recent game, Prince of Persia, was an unrelated reboot, so Ubisoft inserted a fourth game into the \"trilogy\" in order to try and make money off of the movie. Although generally regarded as unnecessary and not living up to the heights of its predecessors, The Forgotten Sands generally reviewed well, and is considered a competent, if unremarkable, game in its own right.</p><p>It's worth noting that the main release of the game on PC, Xbox 360, and PS3 was very different from other version released on the Nintendo Wii, Nintendo DS, and PlayStation Portable.

The series broke new ground with its high quality of voice-acting and engaging storyline featuring complex and often dark characters. Crystal Dynamics took over development after the release of the first game and went on to add four sequels.</p><p>The series is set in the mythical realm of <a href=\"/nosgoth/3035-278/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-278\">Nosgoth</a> where the land's two dominant races, the Ancient Vampires and the Hylden, are locked in an ageless war for its control. Much of the story revolves around the vampire Kain and his destiny as Nosgoth's savior. The franchise was unique at the time for its choice of an anti-hero as a protagonist. The other main protagonist introduced later in Soul Reaver is <a href=\"/raziel/3005-1357/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1357\">Raziel</a>, Kain's former first lieutenant and now his mortal enemy. The storyline features a variety of dark, manipulative characters with betrayal and deception as common themes throughout the series. The game's story is non-linear with Kain and Raziel frequently traveling back in history to change Nosgoth's fate.</p><h2>Development</h2><p>The first game in the franchise, Blood Omen, was the brain child of <a href=\"/denis-dyack/3040-20252/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-20252\">Denis Dyack</a>. He wanted to create an action adventure game for a more mature audience which would require good puzzle solving skills and test a players mental and physical dexterity. Silicon Knights filed a lawsuit over the Legacy of Kain IP in 1998 after they discovered that a Blood Omen game was in development exclusively by Crystal Dynamics. After a private settlement, Crystal Dynamics continued with the development. The remaining games in the series were directed by <a href=\"/amy-hennig/3040-20959/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-20959\">Amy Hennig</a> and continued with Dyack's vision of videos game set in a morbid world.</p><h2>Games</h2><p>There have been five games in the series so far.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/87790/1795897-box_lokbo.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1795897\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.96691176470588\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:96.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/87790/1795897-box_lokbo.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1795897\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/1795897-box_lokbo.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/8/87790/1795897-box_lokbo.png 544w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/1795897-box_lokbo.png 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/1795897-box_lokbo.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a></figure><p><a href=\"/blood-omen-legacy-of-kain/3030-8736/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8736\"><b>Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain</b></a> - Released in 1996 on the PC and the Playstation, this Silicon Knights action adventure game laid down the groundwork for the rest of the series to build on. Blood Omen introduces us to Kain, once a nobleman but now a bitter and vengeful vampire, as he struggles to come to terms with his \"dark gift\". We follow his story as he is manipulated and betrayed at every turn and used as a pawn for much of the game. The storyline is dark,complex and tells a tragic tale about the dying world of Nosgoth. Played from an isometric perspective, the gameplay involved traditional action adventure elements with a good amount of puzzle solving. The game received good reviews and was generally praised for its great voice work and story.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/87790/1795901-box_loksr.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1795901\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.1475409836066\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:114.8%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/87790/1795901-box_loksr.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1795901\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/8/87790/1795901-box_loksr.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/8/87790/1795901-box_loksr.png 549w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/1795901-box_loksr.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 557px) 100vw, 557px\" data-width=\"557\"></a></figure><p><b><a href=\"/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver/3030-6249/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6249\">Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver</a></b> - After a legal battle with Silicon Knights, Crystal Dynamics took over development of the franchise and their first addition was 1999's Soul Reaver on the PC and the Playstation. The gameplay switched to a third person action adventure and added a great deal to the puzzle solving element of the first game. It also let players explore the world freely, thus leading to a non-linear experience. The biggest change however was that players now took control of Kain's first lieutenant, Raziel as he is banished at the very start of the game. The game tells his story as he seeks vengeance by killing his former brothers. Kain, the hero from the first game is portrayed as an antagonist here. Soul Reaver is known for its infamous cliffhanger ending, leaving the players wanting more. The game earned some great reviews, with an average rating of <a href=\"http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/197762.asp?q=soul%20reaver\" rel=\"nofollow \">88%</a> on gamerankings.com.

The game was released on the PC and the Playstation 2. The story picks up right where Soul Reaver left. Players take up the role of the anti-hero, Raziel as he continues to pursue Kain across different timelines and discovers his true destiny. The game also explores the history of Nosgoth and in particular, the blade <a href=\"/the-soul-reaver/3055-396/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-396\">Soul Reaver</a> . The combat was more involved than the previous game and the enemy AI was also revamped. Players can also use the wraith blade, Soul Reaver, at any time and much of the gameplay revolves around its different forms. The graphics got a significant boost, having switched from the PS to PS2. The puzzle structure also moved away from the block-puzzles used in the previous game.

The game was released on the PC and all three consoles available at the time \u2013 PS2, Xbox and Gamecube. It was developed in parallel to Soul Reaver 2 by another team and actually takes place as a result of events in that game. Blood Omen 2 follows the story of a young and ambitious Kain in his quest to establish his empire in Nosgoth. The world has a weird sort of industrial feel to it as technology mixed with magic. We find out early on that Kain failed in his earlier crusade and was basically out cold for 200 years. Players spend much of the game trying to gain back Kain's powers and gather a big enough army to lead another assault. The gameplay involves straightforward combat and simple puzzles. It continued the tradition of great voice acting and storytelling in the series.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/151058-front_cover.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-151058\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0\"><a  href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/151058-front_cover.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-151058\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/151058-front_cover.jpg\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/151058-front_cover.jpg\"></noscript></a></figure><p><b><a href=\"/legacy-of-kain-defiance/3030-823/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-823\">Legacy of Kain: Defiance</a></b> - The final game in the series so far, Defiance was developed and released by Crystal Dynamics in 2003. For the first time, the player takes control of both Kain and Raziel in the same game as the story is told from their different perspectives. Released on the Xbox, PS2 and PC, the game used a new camera setting to give it a more cinematic look. The gameplay builds up on the more action oriented Soul Reaver 2 with simple puzzle solving sections. The plot picks up where Soul Reaver 2 left as Kain and Raziel seek to defy their destinies and save themselves and Nosgoth.

Fatalism and predestined futures are major themes in all the games with Kain and Raziel continuously seeking to defy their fate and write their own futures. The existence (or lack ) of free will is another important component in all the games. Raziel and Kain present the opposite sides on this debate, with Raziel being the champion of free will and Kain being a fatalistic character.</p><p>Betrayal is another common theme in all the games, with almost every character seeking to manipulate the two main protagonists in the series. Moebius and the Elder God can be seen as examples of <a href=\"/unreliable-narrator/3015-191/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-191\">unreliable narrators</a> as they try to influence Raziel.

These vampires are very similar to the the vampires in other mythos and have similar strengths and weaknesses like exposure to sunlight, impalement, fire and water.These vampires have the ability to evolve over time and sometimes go into a stage of accelerated metamorphosis where they develop new features. For example, Raziel was the first vampire to develop wings. Due to this rapid evolution, they are different from the humans in characteristics. Sadly, one of the side effects of vampirism is sterility, so they had to resort to necromancy to create new members of their race.</p><p>Vampires are divided into separate clans and their characteristics depend on their leaders.

The humans created a clan of zealot warrior priests, The Sarafan, to fight the \"vampire plague\". Their crusade lead to the demise of Janos Audron and nearly wiped out the vampires. They succeded in capturing the \"Heart of Darkness\" and the famed blade \" <a href=\"/the-soul-reaver/3055-396/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-396\">Soul Reaver</a>\". All of Kain's six lieutenants were once Sarafan priests until their crusade was stopped by a mysterious wraith who killed them in their own stronghold.</p><p>About 500 years later (during the events of <a href=\"/blood-omen-legacy-of-kain/3030-8736/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8736\">Blood Omen</a>), <a href=\"/moebius/3005-3098/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3098\">Moebius</a> The Timestreamer lead another genocidal crusade against the vampires in the name of the Sarafan. Kain was the only survivor of Moebius's crusade. Another 200 years after the original crusade, the clan was reformed by a self-proclaimed \"Sarafan Lord\". Only this time, their aim was the total conquest of all Nosgoth. With a hint of irony, it was the Vampire Kain who ended their rule and freed Nosgoth.</p><h3>Hylden</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/346285-hylden.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-346285\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.0186335403727\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:101.9%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/346285-hylden.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-346285\"><img alt=\" Demons in the demon realm\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 628px) 100vw, 628px\" data-width=\"628\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/3661/346285-hylden.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/3661/346285-hylden.jpg 322w\"><noscript><img alt=\" Demons in the demon realm\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/3661/346285-hylden.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/3661/346285-hylden.jpg 322w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 628px) 100vw, 628px\" data-width=\"628\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Demons in the demon realm</figcaption></figure><p>The Hylden are an ancient race in the world of Nosgoth and play an antagonistic role in the series. They have the ability to posses other creatures and bend them to their will.They waged war against the Ancients for centuries before being banished to a realm populated with demons. But in a final act of vengeance, they cursed their enemies with sterility, bloodthirst and immortality thus turning them into Vampires. Trapped for eternity in the demon realm, they plotted their comeback by infiltrating the Circle of Nine thus leading to the events of Blood Omen and Kain's fateful choice. During the events of <a href=\"/legacy-of-kain-blood-omen-2/3030-11203/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11203\">Blood Omen 2</a>, a Hylden under the name of \" <a href=\"/hashakgik/3005-5936/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5936\">Sarafan Lord</a>\" tried to conquer Nosgoth. They continue to play an important role in the series, by manipulating and controlling key characters.</p><h2>Other Beings</h2><h3>The Elder God</h3><p>A mysterious being worshiped by the Ancients, believing it to be the master of the 'Wheel of Fate' and the architect of destiny. Its titanic form is a mass eyes with hour-glass pupils set amidst a thicket of octopus-like tentacles. While occupying both the material and astral planes, it is invisible to everyone save for Raziel, though its disembodied voice could be heard over great distances by both Raziel, Kain, and Moebius. After the Hylden's curse turned the Ancients into vampires, the Elder God turned from them rather than attempting to help it's stricken followers. It helped to manipulate events by resurrecting Raziel and making him into it's own personal Soul Reaver. Aside from cajoling Raziel to take vengeance upon Kain, it also demands its defiant servant to 'liberate' the stagnating souls in vampires and the creatures of the astral plane in order to return them to 'the Wheel'.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><p>The soundtrack throughout the series maintains a moody feel and constantly changes with the ingame context. The Blood Omen soundtrack was composed by <a href=\"/steven-s-henifin/3040-12535/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-12535\">Steve Henifin</a>, the lead music composer at Silicon Knights. After Crystal Dynamics took over development, <a href=\"/amy-hennig/3040-20959/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-20959\">Amy Hennig</a> hired <a href=\"/kurt-harland/3040-21371/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-21371\">Kurt Harland</a> to work with their lead audio engineer, <a href=\"/jim-hedges/3040-21372/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-21372\">Jim Hedges</a>, for the soundtrack on Soul Reaver. <a href=\"http://www.insoc.com.br/english/mix/eyep.php\" rel=\"nofollow \">According to Kurt</a>, the producers were impressed with his track \"Ozar Midrashim\" from the <i>Information Society</i> album \"Don't be Afraid\" (this very track was used the as Opening theme in Soul Reaver). <a href=\"http://www.iasig.org/pubs/interviews/eidosjh.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow \">In an interview with IAsig</a>, the team explains the adaptive soundtrack which fades in/out depending on the combat state of the player. The music incorporates many environmental sounds and foley techniques.</p><p>Later on the series, Jim Hedges took over composition as well and provided the music for Blood Omen 2 and Defiance.</p><h2>Legacy of Kain Timeline</h2><p>The games feature an extensive amount of time traveling, making it hard to follow some of the events.

Lego Island was very well received for its interactive environments, simple gameplay mechanics, humor, and soundtrack. The goal in the game is to capture <a href=\"/the-brickster/3005-4753/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4753\">The Brickster</a> (once the player lets him out) and put him back into jail, but beyond that there are few necessary objectives.

An action-adventure game, Lego Island 2 centers around a quest to retrieve the blueprints of every building on Lego Island (rebuilding it) and then capturing the Brickster once again.</p><p>The third and final game in the franchise, <a href=\"/island-xtreme-stunts/3030-20310/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20310\">Island Xtreme Stunts</a>, dropped the \"Lego\" in the title, and offered another action-adventure game starring Pepper Roni (just like the second game).

Lego Racers 2 has a variety of worlds to explore, talking to characters and (naturally) racing. Each of the five worlds available are based of off a particular theme, such as space or dinosaurs. In addition to the completely new worlds, Lego Racers 2 has numerous power-ups that can serve many purposes, such as stealth and weapons.</p><p>Another Lego racing game was released in 2000, and was developed by <a href=\"/graphic-state-limited/3010-2393/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2393\">Graphic State Games</a>. <a href=\"/lego-stunt-rally/3030-7480/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7480\">Lego Stunt Rally</a> featured a track builder and new power-ups. The track builder can be used to build tracks for both single player and multiplayer games. One aspect of the game that was dramatically different from other Lego racing games is the fact that steering is completely controlled by the computer. Acceleration, braking, and lane changing are the only aspects the player is in control of, completely changing the way the game is played.</p><p>The fourth Lego racing game drastically changed settings and themes from the first two games. <a href=\"/drome-racers/3030-13396/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13396\">Drome Racers</a> was released for the PC, <a href=\"/gamecube/3045-23/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-23\">GameCube</a>, <a href=\"/game-boy-advance/3045-4/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-4\">Game Boy Advance</a>, <a href=\"/playstation-2/3045-19/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-19\">PlayStation 2</a>, and <a href=\"/xbox/3045-32/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-32\">Xbox</a> on November 20, 2002. The game was not incredibly well received, garnering mediocre reception across all platforms. Based off of the 2002 \"Team Nitro\" Lego sets, Drome Racers sets Lego racing in the year 2015.

Two very unique Lego games were <a href=\"/lego-technic-cybermaster/3030-18870/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18870\">Lego Technic Cybermaster</a> (1998) and <a href=\"/lego-friends/3030-2435/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2435\">Lego Friends</a> (1999).

Believing that the Leisure Suit represented the pinnacle of fashion (probably after a misguided Saturday Night Fever viewing), Larry sets out to find his, um... \"fortune\". Throughout the various games in the series, players guide Larry through a variety of locations, including versions of US cities <a data-ref-id=\"3035-78\" href=\"/las-vegas/3035-78/\" slug=\"las-vegas\">Las Vegas</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3035-490\" href=\"/los-angeles/3035-490/\" slug=\"los-angeles\">Los Angeles</a>, cruise ships, and tropical islands. The series <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2257\" href=\"/humor/3015-2257/\" slug=\"humor\">humor</a> typically centers around the misguided attempts of Larry to seduce each game's many female characters, and the equally strange <a data-ref-id=\"3015-932\" href=\"/puzzles/3015-932/\" slug=\"puzzles\">puzzles</a> that players must solve in order to progress.</p><p>The first three games in the series form a trilogy, with the third game ending with Larry writing his memoirs in the form of a computer game. The final three games also follow off of each other, but there is no conclusion to the overall story arc as with the third game in the series.</p><h2>Larry 4</h2><p>Looking at the games in the series, it's fairly obvious that there was never a Leisure Suit Larry 4. <a data-ref-id=\"3030-4487\" href=\"/leisure-suit-larry-iii-passionate-patti-in-pursuit-of-the-pulsating-pectorals/3030-4487/\" slug=\"leisure-suit-larry-iii-passionate-patti-in-pursuit-of-the-pulsating-pectorals\">LSL3</a> ends with Larry writing the introduction to the first game, while <a data-ref-id=\"3030-11781\" href=\"/leisure-suit-larry-5-passionate-patti-does-a-little-undercover-work/3030-11781/\" slug=\"leisure-suit-larry-5-passionate-patti-does-a-little-undercover-work\">LSL5</a> begins with Larry having no memory of how he came to be working for a record company. Later, there are references back to \"Leisure Suit Larry 4: The Missing Floppies\", or other events that might have happened in the intervening years. Some fans wondered where the missing game was, leading to speculation that it was never released for fear of being too explicit, however the real story is far more mundane.</p><p>Series creator <a data-ref-id=\"3040-987\" href=\"/al-lowe/3040-987/\" slug=\"al-lowe\">Al Lowe</a> has explained that there was never intended to be another game after the trilogy was finished. This is why all the loose ends are tied at and the end of LSL3, and Al went on to work on new projects. Fans wanted more Larry though, so an ambitious project began: to create one of the world's first online-only adventure games. At the time, <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1030\" href=\"/sierra-entertainment-inc/3010-1030/\" slug=\"sierra-entertainment-inc\">Sierra</a> was working on a new online gaming service that would eventually become INN (The Imagination Network), and LarryLand was going to be one of the premier applications to run on the service (which incidentally ran on several chassis filled with 2400 baud modems). In order to get a feel for how game might work online, the team created some simple chess, poker, and blackjack games, as well as an avatar creation system that used preset elements to define a character. All the research was to determine how much could be done with as little bandwidth as possible, and once some working games were up and showing results, work began on the online Larry game. A graphic adventure game however, proved to be more compicated than simple turn based games, and work on the project was eventually scrapped. The team moved on to other projects, but demand for a new Larry game continued. Al Lowe has cited a few reasons for skipping the numbering, but the two primary ones seem to be that it got him out of having to write a way out of the LSL3 ending, and that it was just really funny to make people think they missed a game.</p><h2>Larry 8</h2><p>After the release of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-11734\" href=\"/leisure-suit-larry-love-for-sail/3030-11734/\" slug=\"leisure-suit-larry-love-for-sail\">Love for Sail</a>, there was an announcement of Leisure Suit Larry 8: Lust in Space, and even a demo of a 3d rendered Larry Laffer released on the internet. Unfortunately, the project was canceled after Sierra closed its adventure games division.</p><h2>Magna Cum Laude</h2><p>The series was later given a reboot of sorts in 2004 with the release of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-17050\" href=\"/leisure-suit-larry-magna-cum-laude/3030-17050/\" slug=\"leisure-suit-larry-magna-cum-laude\">Leisure Suit Larry: Magna Cum Laude</a>. Developed by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-549\" href=\"/high-voltage-software-inc/3010-549/\" slug=\"high-voltage-software-inc\">High Voltage Software</a>, series creator Al Lowe was not involved.

The game also broke away from the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-75\" href=\"/point-and-click/3015-75/\" slug=\"point-and-click\">point-and-click</a> adventure genre, instead using an <a data-ref-id=\"3015-207\" href=\"/open-world/3015-207/\" slug=\"open-world\">open-world</a> format as popularized by <a data-ref-id=\"3030-3724\" href=\"/grand-theft-auto-iii/3030-3724/\" slug=\"grand-theft-auto-iii\">Grand Theft Auto III</a>.</p>", "guid": "3025-450", "name": "Leisure Suit Larry"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-451", "name": "Lemmings"}, {"description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Created by <a href=\"/game-freak-inc/3010-2534/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2534\">Game Freak</a> and published by <a href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-90\">Nintendo</a>, the Pok\u00e9mon, or Pocket Monsters, series began on March 21,1996, with the original Japanese Game Boy release of Pok\u00e9mon Red and Green, later released in North America as <a href=\"/pokemon-redblue/3030-3966/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3966\">Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue</a>.

The player can use their own Pok\u00e9mon to battle them, allowing them to capture the Pok\u00e9mon for future use. There are currently 898 different Pok\u00e9mon in the series, and not all can be captured in a single game. Players can use a <a href=\"/pokedex/3055-1310/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1310\">Pok\u00e9dex</a> to keep track of all Pok\u00e9mon seen and captured.</p><p>Each Pok\u00e9mon has one or two types (out of a total of 18), and can learn up to 4 different moves at a time. Each Pok\u00e9mon has a base stat point distribution, spread between 6 stats: Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, Speed, and HP. Pok\u00e9mon earn <a href=\"/experience-points/3015-39/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-39\">experience</a> every time they make an opponent faint, and will increase their stats automatically every time they level up. From the third Generation onward, Pok\u00e9mon also have a nature, which will increase or decrease certain stats, and an ability, which is a special attribute that might help (or hinder) it in battle. Players can affect their Pok\u00e9mon stat point gain through Effort Value (EV) and Individual Value (IV) manipulation, which can boost a Pok\u00e9mon's stat points significantly.</p><p>Many Pok\u00e9mon can evolve, changing to a new form with slightly different abilities, upon meeting certain prerequisites, typically a set experience level. The Pok\u00e9mon will retain its moves, nature, EVs, and IVs, but will gain (or sometimes lose) stat points. Some evolutions will also change the Pok\u00e9mon's type or abilities, and gain access to new skills that might not have been available in their previous form. Some Pok\u00e9mon have branching evolutions, where the Pok\u00e9mon can evolve into a different Pok\u00e9mon based on their evolution method.</p><p>Pok\u00e9mon are captured using special capsule-like devices known as <a href=\"/poke-ball/3055-425/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-425\">Pok\u00e9 Balls</a>. These balls are bought, found, or sometimes made, and can only be used on wild Pok\u00e9mon. There are many different types of balls, from the basic red-and-white Pok\u00e9 Ball to the Master Ball, a valuable ball which will capture any wild Pok\u00e9mon without fail. Players can also trade their Pok\u00e9mon, either through local connections, or via a global trading system first introduced with the series' fourth Generation.</p><h2>Main Games</h2><p>The main series of Pok\u00e9mon titles is divided into different generations, roughly indicating a pair of releases. Each generation features a new region, with new Pok\u00e9mon to catch and new places to explore. The main games and their spin-offs, the anime, the manga, and the trading card game are all updated with the new Pok\u00e9mon properties each time a new generation begins.</p><h3>First Generation (Kanto)</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/25/11308-bluescreen.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-11308\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.67293233082707\" data-width=\"798\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 798px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:67.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/25/11308-bluescreen.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-11308\"><img alt=\"Pok\u00e9mon Red/Blue\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/25/11308-bluescreen.gif\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/25/11308-bluescreen.gif 798w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/25/11308-bluescreen.gif 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/25/11308-bluescreen.gif 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Pok\u00e9mon Red/Blue</figcaption></figure><p>The first games in the series were <a href=\"/pokemon-redblue/3030-3966/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3966\">Pok\u00e9mon Red/Blue</a> (Red/Green in Japan), released September 1998 in America for the <a href=\"/game-boy/3045-3/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-3\">Game Boy</a>.

The series typically revolves around groups of high school students, and takes place in modern day Japan with a heavy focus on occult plots of world destruction and rebirth, potential Messiahs/Antichrists, and a myriad of personae.</p><p>The personae (or personas), being one of the strong binding elements of the series, are what provide the magic and special in-battle abilities of the characters throughout the games. Taking heavy influence from various gods and demons from many different world cultures and religions, as well as the major arcana associated with the twenty-two tarot cards.</p><h2>The Term \"Persona\"</h2><p>The term \"persona,\" as derived from the psychology term, also has a vital meaning to the series. Persona, meaning the mask or appearance one presents to the world. The persona is not a facade or some other intentional misrepresentation of the self to others. Rather, it is the self that naturally presents itself to the various people we deal with in our lives and may change according to situation and context. This theme is always a core concept explored in the stories presented in the series.</p><h2>Using Persona</h2><p>Personae give their users strength in battle. The type of Persona being used has a significant influence on that character's abilities in combat. The character's stats, elemental affinities, and skills available are all decided by the Persona currently equipped. Having a wide variety of Personae available and using them appropriately is the key to success.</p><p>How characters can use the ability of Persona has differed depending on the game. In Persona 1 and 2, all characters were capable of using multiple Persona. Persona are grouped into different classes called Arcana, and each character has different levels of compatibility with each Arcana. As a result, some characters would be able to use a Persona of a given Arcana more effectively than other characters, and some characters would simply be unable to use a certain Arcana at all.</p><p>Persona 3 and 4 changed the use of Persona so that only the main character could switch between multiple Personae. Instead of having affinities, the protagonist would be able to use a Persona of any Arcana with equal ability. The other characters only had access to a single Persona each, which is capable of eventually evolving into a more powerful version of itself.</p><h2>Games</h2><p>Although the Persona series' time-line is fairly straight forward, with each new game that is released the series changes so much that it is hard to believe the stories all connect.</p><h3><a href=\"/shin-megami-tensei-persona/3030-6557/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6557\">Revelations: Persona</a></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15405/747032-persona1_box.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-747032\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"299\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 299px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15405/747032-persona1_box.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-747032\"><img alt=\"Revelations: Persona\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/15405/747032-persona1_box.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/15405/747032-persona1_box.png 299w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 299px) 100vw, 299px\" data-width=\"299\"></a><figcaption>Revelations: Persona</figcaption></figure><p><b>Original Release Date:</b> September 20, 1996</p><p><b>Platforms:</b> <a href=\"/playstation/3045-22/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-22\">PS1</a>, <a href=\"/pc/3045-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">Windows</a>, <a href=\"/psp/3045-18/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-18\">PSP</a></p><p>The first game in the series centers around a group of teenagers that use melee weapons, firearms, and their Personas to defeat demons in random encounters.

Instead of joining a secret organization (<a href=\"/\">SEES</a>) to battle shadows during the \"Dark Hour\", the game simply follows a young group of high schoolers who find themselves discovering their Persona ability while trying to solve the mysterious murders being perpetrated in their town.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/87790/2280496-box_p4a.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2280496\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.2023529411765\" data-width=\"425\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 425px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:120.2%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/87790/2280496-box_p4a.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2280496\"><img alt=\"Persona 4 Arena\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 532px) 100vw, 532px\" data-width=\"532\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/8/87790/2280496-box_p4a.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/8/87790/2280496-box_p4a.png 425w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Persona 4 Arena\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/8/87790/2280496-box_p4a.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/8/87790/2280496-box_p4a.png 425w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 532px) 100vw, 532px\" data-width=\"532\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Persona 4 Arena</figcaption></figure><p>Combat takes place in dungeons modeled after the hidden personality of the character who will be murdered next.

The role playing mechanics are based off of Super Mario RPG; attacking and defending are largely based on timing, with attacks rewarding more damage for well-timed attacks. <a href=\"/mario/3005-177/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-177\">Mario</a> also has a set number of health points and flower points (for special attacks). Gaining experience levels Mario up, which can be done in combat.</p><p>Another key part of every Paper Mario game are the partners acquired on Mario's adventure. Each partner has a special ability both in the overworld and in battle to assist Mario in solving puzzles and fighting. Mario can only travel with one partner at a time, but this can be switched out at any time.</p><p>Badges are purchased and equipped, and then give a variety of effects based on the badge. Each badge takes up a set amount of badge points, so Mario can only equip so many badges. Badge effects range from helpful (boosted health or stats, regeneration, item or Star Point bonuses, special attacks/armor, etc.) to humorous (changing Mario's costume or shoes). In addition to buying badges, Mario can purchase a wide array of items (and even combine them in cooking minigames).</p><h3>Differences in Gameplay</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/508329-spm2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-508329\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.6093023255814\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.9%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/508329-spm2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-508329\"><img alt=\"Flipping to 3D in Super Paper Mario\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/5911/508329-spm2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/5911/508329-spm2.jpg 430w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/5911/508329-spm2.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Flipping to 3D in Super Paper Mario\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/5911/508329-spm2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/5911/508329-spm2.jpg 430w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/5911/508329-spm2.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Flipping to 3D in Super Paper Mario</figcaption></figure><p>While the general gameplay remains the same, The Thousand-Year Door and Super Paper Mario both differed from the original formula. In The Thousand-Year Door, gameplay was largely unchanged. Only a few gameplay aspects were added or edited. For example, battles now take place in front of an audience, and depending on how well the player is doing in battle, the audience has a chance of assisting or hurting Mario.</p><p>Super Paper Mario is where the gameplay was more radically altered. The first two games were role playing games with platforming aspects, while Super Paper Mario flipped the concept into a platforming game with role playing aspects. The third game also features the unique ability to flip between 2D and 3D, opening up new areas and used extensively in the puzzles and enemies in the game. Battles no longer take place in Super Paper Mario. Instead Mario uses traditional <a href=\"/super-mario-bros/3030-15544/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15544\">Super Mario Bros.</a> tactics, and stomps his way through enemies.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4938/424846-336111.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-424846\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.60625\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.6%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4938/424846-336111.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-424846\"><img alt=\"Goombario, Mario's first partner in the entire series.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4938/424846-336111.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/4938/424846-336111.jpg 640w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4938/424846-336111.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4938/424846-336111.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Goombario, Mario's first partner in the entire series.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4938/424846-336111.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/4938/424846-336111.jpg 640w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4938/424846-336111.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4938/424846-336111.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Goombario, Mario's first partner in the entire series.</figcaption></figure><p>All three games are known for their humorous and entertaining plots.

Each tower housed thousands of monsters which once activated would eliminate any human resistance. The idea being that this would prevent pollution, overpopulation and wars.</p><p>There are many towers throughout the Panzer Dragoon World, they vary on form from the static structures seen in <a data-ref-id=\"3030-3692\" href=\"/panzer-dragoon-saga/3030-3692/\" slug=\"panzer-dragoon-saga\">Panzer Dragoon Saga</a>, to the gigantic flying Shelcoof from <a data-ref-id=\"3030-9353\" href=\"/panzer-dragoon-ii-zwei/3030-9353/\" slug=\"panzer-dragoon-ii-zwei\">Panzer Dragoon Zwei</a>. All of them are controlled by a central entity called Sestren whom <a data-ref-id=\"3005-723\" href=\"/edge/3005-723/\" slug=\"edge\">Edge</a> defeats at the conclusion of the third game.</p><h2>The Heresy Program</h2><p>The Heresy program was created by an unknown group of Ancients who sought the destruction of the Towers. Originally they tried to destroy them by deploying the program directly into sestren but the program was rejected and their plan failed. The program survived by inhabiting living creatures, then altering their creatures DNA. The Mutant Coolia discovered by Jean-Luc Lundi at the start of Panzer Dragoon Zwei is one such creature. If allowed to mature these creatures will then evolve into fully grown Dragons intent on destroying the towers.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The games in the franchise are primarily based on an on-rails format that limits the player to a pre-determined path (multiple paths in later games) where the only control they have over the dragon is to avoid attacks and obstacles. You also control a reticle for targeting enemies with both your rider's weapon and the dragons' attacks. A staple of the series is the locking on of multiple targets then releasing a barrage of homing attacks after charging for a period of time.</p><p>The different game mechanics can be traced back to previous Sega arcade titles like Space Harrier and After Burner, including the lock-on function and the ability to traverse on the ground and the air at will.</p><h2>Art Design</h2><p>Much has been said about the distinct art style of the franchise. When it initially was shown, the refreshing style and fully imagined world were astounding where robots and cartoon characters were common place in the games of the time. This is also responsible in some way of ushering in the new era of 32-bit gaming where high production values could allow games to look much more cinematic and detailed with the new technology.</p><p>The art design in the Panzer Dragoon series has always been attributed to the works of Moebius. While he himself only produced a number of concept paintings and the cover art for the first game, his involvement was predominantly as inspiration. The otherworldly landscapes of barren desert dotted with ancient ruins under a cloudless stark blue sky, with humans wearing attire of nomadic hunters riding fantastical beasts are the stuff games are made of.</p>", "guid": "3025-461", "name": "Panzer Dragoon"}, {"description": "<p>Pandemonium is a series of 2.5D platformers staring Fargus (a joker) and Nikki (a trainee sorcress).

The original Pac-Man was released in arcades on May 22, 1980.

From then on, Pac-Man became a gaming and merchandising  icon, inspiring clothes, toys, television shows, and even  pasta. At the time, most of the games in arcades were shooters, but Pac-Man was different than the other games of the time.

The basic premise is that the player drives a Ferrari and has to get from Point A to Point B. Unlike other driving games there is only one track in each game, however the track forks through a variety of environments and terrain, making for various route combinations. It should be noted the repeated use of the word driving game is due to no other racers to compete with, as the player's biggest enemy is time.

Luffy who dreamed of becoming king of the pirates since he was little and started achieving his dream after eating the cursed Gum-Gum fruit that turned his body into rubber. Along the way he meets many characters who will eventually become part of his crew. Zoro, a man who wants to become the best swordsman in the sea. Sanji, who wants to become the best cook. Nami, who wants to become the best navigator, and Chopper, who wants to become the best doctor. He also meets many other characters. These characters help him along the way in his dream to becoming the king of the pirates by finding the legendary treasure at the Grand Line called One Piece.</p><h2>Setting</h2><p>The world of One Piece is a planet consisting of two oceans divided by a giant mountain in the middle spanning across the world called the Red Line, a gigantic mountain said to be 10,000 meters deep, and high enough to be impossible to pass through normal means. On both sides of the Red Line are the two oceans further divided by a line perpendicular to the Red Line called the Grand Line, the first half called Paradise, and the second called the New World. There is the east and south sea on one side divided by the Grand Line, and the north and west sea divided by the Paradise. Both the Grand Line and Paradise on both sides have a border that separates there seas called the Calm Belt. The Calm Belt is a line with no wind, meaning little movement in the water, making an environment for giant sea creatures called Sea Kings to be rampant, it is such a dangerous and powerful barrier, one can't simply cross without certain aids like sea prism stone. To cross the red lines one must go through reverse mountain, a mountain where the water stream is going upwards instead of down, have government permission to enter Mariejois also known as the holy land. Or go through fishman island and enter a passage there. The Grand Line has unpredictable and unstable weather causing the magnetic field to render most compasses useless. So Paradise requires a special compass called a log pose, these compasses use the magnetic field of islands to lock on to, changing whenever near another island. However once in the New World, it requires a variant of the log pose with three needles instead of one, due to islands sometimes randomly hiding, or changing there magnetic fields.</p><p>The world is mostly a vast ocean, with islands scattered everywhere. These islands come in many forms from desert to winter to sky islands. Special islands like the sky islands hover above the clouds, and some are artificially made like an island suspended in the air by balloons. A giant elephant reaching above the clouds, and walks trough the sea carrying islands on their backs. Some ships are so large, they are even considered islands themselves like Thriller Bark, or the Gran Tesoro.</p><h2>Population</h2><p>The population inhabiting the world of One Piece are Humans, Fishmen, Minks, Dwarves, Mermaids/Mermen, and Giants.</p><p><strong>Humans</strong> make up the majority of the populous. Humans are also the most advanced in the word having the highest intelligence, with people like Vegapunk, and Nami. Humans are also very inconsistent at times. Take Gekko Moriah, doesn't look like a Human at all, yet is considered a human, and Charlotte Linlin, she's Human yet the size of a giant with abnormal strength rivaling giants. In terms of technology it's weird, they don't have aerial machines, but have giant mechanical robots that can fire lasers, as well as cyborgs. Humans have also replicated devil fruits, yet still use flintlock guns, and wooden ships. Some are more primitive then others, compare Alabasta to the Gran Tesoro.</p><p><strong>Fishmen</strong>, human and fish hybrids taking a humanoid form with fish attributes; gills, webbed fingers. They have extremely good swimming, underwater breathing along with super-strength. These people live under the ocean along with Merfolk, most humans dislike the fishmen. Some people of the fishmen race are Arlong, Hatchan. A shark humanoid, and an octopus humanoid with eight arms. Fishmen have such great swimming capabilities that in a group they can completely change the current and tide of the ocean. They also possess a special fighting style called Fishman Karate. Fishman karate is when the user uses the water in their vicinity to deal devastating blows to opponents, they can use the water of the opponent to further deal damage, humans can also learn this as Koala did. Another fighting style called Fishman Jujustu. The user while in water can manipulate it to become tangible, humans are unable to learn this. When a fishman eats a Devil Fruit, they can no longer swim, but can still breathe underwater. In terms of technology they are equivalent to Romans, they are the typical depiction of the legendary lost kingdom of Atlantis.</p><p><strong>Merfolk</strong>,<strong> </strong>human and fish hybrids with a human top, and fish bottom, a typical depiction of mermaid/mermen. Like Fishmen, merfolks have extremely good swimming capabilities and underwater breathing with super-strength. These people live under the ocean along with Fishmen. Most humans dislike the Fishmen, however opposite for the merfolk, female merfolk in particular as they are often said to be the most beautiful race. Some people of the merfolk race are Shirahoshi, and Sharley. A white-smelting fish, and a shark mermaid. Like fishmen they can't learn Fishmen karate where you use the water in the opponent's body against themselves. However like fishmen they can learn Fishman Jujustu, however it's called 'Merfolk Combat', with the same concept of turning water tangible. It's unknown what happens when a fishman eats a Devil Fruit. Like fishmen they're technology are equivalent to Romans, they are the typical depiction of the legendary lost kingdom of Atlantis.</p><p><strong>Minks</strong>, human and animal hybrids taking a humanoid form with fur of varying sizes, with the ability to generate electricity. They are similar to Humans who use a zoan fruit possessing higher stamina, and strength. Not all minks are the same, some have amazing acrobatics, are agile, and leap great distances, some have extremely powerful brute strength, and some are very stealthy that even high levels of kenbunshoku haki can't sense them.The sizes range from small to huge, example Bariete a monkey about human knee height, and Inuarashi a hound mink about twice a Human's height. These minks possess the ability to generate electricity called 'Electro' and they use this technique to train weaponry; swords, spears. As well as in there own fighting styles. Minks have in them a secret power called 'Sulong', this is a form minks have they transform to during a full moon. When in their Sulong form, they are extremely powerful in terms of everything, however are completely mindless and often times attack until they drain their stamina and eventually die due to exhaustion. However some members train themselves to control this form, and once controlled are fearsome foes. Most members of the mink race seclude themselves atop a giant elephant called Zunisha far from other civilizations. In terms of technology they are equivalent to the Renaissance times.</p><p><strong>Dwarves</strong>, extremely tiny human and bug hybrids with with a human body but a bug's abdomen as a tail, they come in all sorts of colors. Dwarves are about a finger's length, despite size they are extremely fast runners, and have super-strength being able to destroy a building with a single hit. Dwarves are very close to nature, as they live in the forest in trees and mushrooms. They use a special combat style that takes their size, and nimbleness. Utilizing flips and tricks, as well as their tails. In terms of technology they are equivalent to medieval ages.</p><p><strong>Skypieans/Shandians/Birkans</strong>, all three are essentially humans with wings. All three originated from the moon, but were forced to leave due to drying up the resources. Skypieans and Shandians resided in the sky while the Birkans were on the Blue Sea. They have differing tribes with three unique wing types for their respective tribes. Skypieans have small upward pointed wings, Shandians have large wings that point upwards, and Birkans have wings that point downwards. These wings however possess no real purpose aside from distinguishing one from another. In terms of technology and culture they are much like Aztecs. They also have a very unique type of utility called 'Dials'. Dials are shells that can absorb in certain substance and can release those substances at equal or greater levels then originally absorbs.</p><p><strong>Giants</strong>, essentially humans but at around twelve times a normal human's height which is 15 meters on average(for giants). Giants obviously possess immense strength, and durability, but are slower. They are the largest race by far. Most giants originate from Elbaf. In terms of technology and culture they are much like vikings.</p><p>Other variants of the mentions races are giants with different skin tones(green, red) who are two to four times a fully grown giant's size. People of the snake-neck, who have snake-like necks, long-arms, who have two joints in the arms instead of one, long-legs, who have legs twice as long as a normal human, and three-eyed, who have a third eye in the middle of their forehead and have a special power to read all languages, including the poneglyphs. Cross species are also possible as seen with a giant fishman.</p><p>Slavery is a huge part of the One Piece world, often auctions are the for the rich and noble, most notably the Tenryubitos. The prices for slaves are as so in belly:</p><ul><li>Humans - 500,000+</li><li>Dwarves - 700,000+</li><li>Minks - 700,000+</li><li>Long-arm - 700,000+</li><li>Long-leg - 700,000+</li><li>Snake-neck - 700,000+</li><li>Fishman - 1,000,000+</li><li>Giants - Male, 50,000,000+ Female, 10,000,000+</li><li>Merfolk - Male, 1,000,000+ Female, 70,000,000+ Parted female, 10,000,000+</li><li>Devil Fruit users - Market Price</li><li>Other Rare Species - Market Price</li></ul><h2>Devil Fruits</h2><p>Devils Fruits are extremely rare fruits that come in many shapes and sizes. These fruits taste imaginably awful and when eaten the person gains special powers. However the drawbacks are they can no longer swim, once water reaches knee level they start to feel sick, exhausted and sink like an anchor, and sea prism stones when touched weaken the user the same way water does. Devils Fruits however are not limited to sentient beings but also animals as seen with Tony Tony Chopper, and inanimate objects as seen with Lassoo, it is unknown how this works.</p><p>The power of Devil Fruit's are separated into three categories; paramecia, zoan and logia.</p><p><strong>Paramecias</strong> are the most common and can be separated into subcategories, if a Devil Fruit doesn't fit any other main category then it's automatically a Paramecia.</p><ul><li><strong>Enhancers</strong>, these permanently changes the body, and allows the user to take the properties of the substance to some extent, example Luffy's gum-gum.</li><li><strong>Producers</strong>, these allow the user to produce a substance and control it, but cannot transform as the substance, example Nico Robin's flower-flower.</li><li><strong>Transformers</strong>, these allow the user to change the state and property of their body at will, example Mr. 2/Bentham's clone-clone.</li><li><strong>Effectors</strong>, these allow the user to change themselves, others, and the environment. example Trafalgar Law's op-op. Lastly 'special paramecias' it is unknown what a special paramecia is exactly but Charlotte Katakuri has one.</li></ul><p><strong>Zoans</strong> are slightly more rare, they give the user to at will turn into an animal increasing stamina, recovery rate, and strength. Zoans can be separated into subcategories.</p><ul><li><strong>Ancient zoans</strong>, these are much rarer than normal granting the ability to transform into ancient beast; mammoths, dinosaurs etc, example Jack's mammoth.</li><li><strong>Mythical zoans</strong>, these are the rarest devil fruits above logia, granting the ability to transform into mythical creatures; phoenix, buddha, example Marco's phoenix. Something special about the phoenix is that it showed properties of all three types of fruits, intangibility(logia) and healing(paramecia).</li></ul><p><strong>Logias</strong> are the rarest just below mythical zoans. Logias turn the user into a natural element electric, magma, gas, etc. These are considered the most powerful with the ability of intangibility, transformation into an element, and control over the element. The only drawback is that sea prism, and haki will be able to physically contact the user. Users are Eneru, Portgas D Ace/Sabo, Crocodile. A special logia, not officially called a 'special logia' is Marshall D Teach's dark-dark fruit. This fruit allowed the user to negate other's devil fruits(if producers, or logias), but it also didn't give the user intangibility, but instead he actually felt more pain then normal.</p><p>Devil Fruits form once a person who has eaten one dies. The nearest fruit, then transform into the Devil Fruit the person who died had. To identify a Devil Fruit is very simple. They have odd shapes, and patterns usually in spirals repeating across the fruit's body. The color varies across the who spectrum. Devils Fruits however aren't totally limited to nature, but can be artificially create though unknown how. One has been seen in Punk Hazard and was a zoan that gave the user the ability to turn into a small pink version of the traditional Asian dragon. These artificial Devil Fruits look like normal fruits just with dots or other odd patterns, however the shape does not change.</p><p>Sometimes very rarely a user will have totally mastered their fruit and 'awaken' their fruit. These awakenings allows the user to change their surrounding environment into the substance their fruit creates. The full extent is unknown on all fruits, but shown when Donquixote Doflamingo awakened his string-string fruit a paramecia that allowed him to create indestructible string. His awakening was him turning his surroundings to string, then took control over the strings.</p><p>Since Devil Fruits are so rare, they're sometimes sold on the black market for large sums of money. Some can go for 100,000,000 belly and some like the Ope-Ope was going to be sold for 5,000,000,000 belly.</p><h2>Haki</h2><p>Haki is a hidden power in every living being. When this hidden power is awakened, it takes three forms.</p><ul><li><strong>Bosushoku/Armament</strong> haki allows the user to create essentially an invisible armor, capable of immense durability and can damage logias. When used Bosushoku will turn the user's skin pitch black with a purple shine.</li><li><strong>Kenbunskoku/Observation</strong> haki also called mantra in Skypea allows the user to sense the presence of other being even if out of vision, or too far to see.</li><li><strong>Haoshoku/Conqueror/King's Haki</strong> allows the user to unleash their own willpower onto others, if the user is weaker they would collapse unconscious. This form of haki is not obtained through training but given from birth to 1/1,000,000 people.</li></ul><p>All haki can be trained to become stronger. Bosushoku can be trained to the point of near invincibility and allows for full body armament. Kenbunshoku can be trained to the point of seeing the future as seen with Charlotte Katakuri. Haoshoku can be trained through sheer willpower, as the stronger the user's willpower the more people can be knocked out with it.</p><h2>Factions</h2><p>In the world of One Piece there's five main factions and an extra one, but it's a very minor one. These are the Revolutionary Army, World Government/Marines, Yonkos, Shichibukai/Warlords, and the Supernovas.</p><p>The most imposing is the <strong>World Government/Marines</strong>. These people control most of the world, and are the most powerful. The World Government first founded during a time called the 'void century' and era that spanned 800 years. During this time twenty royal families came together to form it. The current ruling heads are the Tenryubito also called the Celestial Dragons and World Nobles, these people have absolute power, infinite fortune, literally being able to do anything they wish in the realm of human possibilities. Below them are the Gorosei, five elderly men who are the true leaders, whiles the Tenryubito are more for show, the Gorosei actually make the decisions. Then below them is Kong a man in charge of the three parts that build the World Government. The Marines, Shichibukai/Warlords, and Cipher Pol. The Marines are the main military power lead by the Fleet Admiral. The Shichibukai are a group of seven of the strongest pirates, banded by the World Government who allow them to pirate without law. Though they still have to listen or have their titles stripped. Then Cipher Pol, the people who act behind the scene, secret agents in in groups code named CP(number); CP0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. The lower the number the stronger the group.</p><p><strong>The Yonkos</strong> also known as the four emperors, currently:</p><ul><li>Charlotte Linlin \"Big Mom\"</li><li>Kaido \"Kaido of the Beasts\" \"The Strongest Creature\"</li><li>Shanks \"Red-Haired Shanks\"</li><li>Marshall D. Teach \"Blackbeard\".</li></ul><p>As well unofficially Monkey D. Luffy, as the fifth yonko. All four excluding Luffy are extremely powerful forces on there own. All have their own giant fleets, and themselves are the strongest of the strong in compared to other pirates. They control their own territories to protect and gain taxes, as for Big Mom candy.</p><p><strong>The Shichibukai/Warlords</strong> are powerful pirates banded together by the World Government. They can continue piracy but have to listen to the World Government, if not they would have their titles stripped. Their bounties are frozen until dismissed. Currently they are:</p><ul><li>Dracule Mihawk \"Hawk-Eye\" \"Strongest Swordsman in the World\"</li><li>Bartholomew Kuma \"Tyrant\"</li><li>Boa Hancock \"Pirate Empress\"</li><li>Buggy \"The Clown\" \"The Star Clown\" \"The Genius Jester\"</li><li>Edward Weevil \"Whitebeard Jr.\"</li></ul><p><strong>The Supernovas</strong> also known as the 'Super Rookies', are any pirate that have a bounty of 100,000,000 or over belly before entering the New World. In Paradise, a bounty of 100,000,000 is considered impressive truly require something horrid to happen to achieve. However once pass that and entering the New World a bounty of 100,000,000 is no longer impressive but considered weak.</p><p><strong>The Revolutionary Army</strong> are the least known about, they are a secret underground group trying to stop the World Government's tyrannical rule. The leader of the revolution known as \"The World's Most-Dangerous Criminal\" and is the most wanted man in the world, Monkey D. Dragon father to Luffy and son of Monkey D. Garp. Little is known but they often carry out these missions that either helps a country, like when they stopped the weapons trade in Dressrosa, or damage the World Government.</p><p>The last group not officially known as a faction. The members of the family of D. These people possess something called \"Will of the D.\". These people have the initial \"D\" in the middle of their names, Monkey D. Luffy, Portgas D. Ace, etc. It's completely unknown what that is, but it is known they are referred to as \"Natural Enemies of God\". The middle name D is inherited.</p>", "guid": "3025-468", "name": "One Piece"}, {"description": "<p>One Must Fall is a fighting game franchise where human fighters remotely control robots and fight in arena battles.</p>", "guid": "3025-469", "name": "One Must Fall"}, {"description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>The Oddworld franchise began in 1997 with the release of <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/oddworld-abes-oddysee/3030-5269/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5269\">Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee</a>.

The series was originally named Ninja Ryukenden, but it changed when the series came to North America. Gaiden literally means \"side-story,\" usually a word reserved for spinoff games. In the PAL region, the series is known as Shadow Warriors. Later installments in the series have been developed by <a href=\"/team-ninja/3010-1764/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1764\">Team Ninja</a>.</p><p>The series has had a variety of installments (many just titled \"Ninja Gaiden\"), spanning many consoles. The series gained popularity in the original Nintendo Entertainment System trilogy for its fast-paced, gritty action, detailed graphics, and cutscenes (one of the first games to feature this innovation). The series has appeared (in various forms) on the arcade, NES, Game Boy, SNES, Master System, Game Gear, Xbox, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Nintendo DS, and Wii Virtual Console. A beta version has also been uncovered for the Mega Drive (Sega Genesis in North America). Various other ports on PC or other systems have been created, but they haven't reached the popularity of the other versions.</p><p><a href=\"/ninja-gaiden-shadow/3030-17825/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17825\">Ninja Gaiden Shadow</a> on the Game Boy isn't technically part of the Ninja Gaiden series, as it is a licensed edit of the NES game <a href=\"/shadow-of-the-ninja/3030-1768/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1768\">Shadow of the Ninja</a>, from <a href=\"/natsume-inc/3010-145/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-145\">Natsume</a>.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The Ninja Gaiden franchise has had many different gameplay changes over the years that the series has been on the market.</p><h3>Ninja Gaiden (Arcade)</h3><p><a href=\"/ninja-gaiden/3030-20744/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20744\">Ninja Gaiden</a>'s first entry as an arcade brawler has been overshadowed by the popularity of the ambitious action platformer released later in the same year on the NES. The player takes control of an unnamed ninja as he travels to various locations in North America, fighting a cult.</p><p>Other than sharing a name, this title is not considered canon to the official series and storyline.</p><h3>NES, SNES, and Game Boy</h3><p>The installments on the NES, SNES, and Game Boy are all of the same gameplay. The NES games introduced many ideas that have now become standard in the series. The trilogy introduced the \"Ninja Arts\" (also known as \"Ninpo\"), detailed story cutscenes, incredibly challenging difficulty level, and the various power-ups of the series. The games centered around Ryu Hayabuse fighting an ancient evil that a cult headed by a character known as <a href=\"/jaquio/3005-237/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-237\">Jaquio</a> is intent on resurrecting to his benefit.</p><p>The three NES games were remade for the SNES game <a href=\"/ninja-gaiden-trilogy/3030-8268/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8268\">Ninja Gaiden Trilogy</a>. Not many things were improved besides graphical detail and soundtrack (which made the game receive some critical reception), but the game is still somewhat of a rare collector's item.</p><p><a href=\"/ninja-gaiden-shadow/3030-17825/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17825\">Ninja Gaiden Shadow</a> on the Game Boy isn't technically part of the Ninja Gaiden series, as it is a licensed edit of the NES game <a href=\"/shadow-of-the-ninja/3030-1768/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1768\">Shadow of the Ninja</a>, from <a href=\"/natsume-inc/3010-145/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-145\">Natsume</a>.

The series began on the PlayStation with LMA Manager in late 1999 and was then followed by LMA Manager 2001, also on the PlayStation, a year later. LMA Manager 2002 was the final game in the series on the original PlayStation. The PlayStation 2 version of the game was released in April 2002. The step up from the PS1 to the PS2 was huge with the expansion of the leagues and a more realistic match engine. Next was LMA Manager 2003, the first game in the series to be released on the Xbox. This game is known by many fans as the best in the series. LMA Manager 2004 was released in March 2004. The game brought a new look to the menu over the last two games. LMA Manager 2005 was released later that year in October. It included three new leagues and featured a mid season roster update via the PlayStation online service and Xbox Live. It was also the first game in the season to have the license to some of the leagues (Football League and the La Liga). LMA Manager 2006 was released on the PS2 and Xbox in November 2005. It was the last game in the series to appear on the original Xbox. The game sported a new look, a new transfer market system, a custom 3D manager you could create and some new leagues avalible in France and Germany. LMA Manager was released on three platforms, the PS2, PC and Xbox 360. The game featured some slight improvements over 2006. To this date, it is the last game in the series.

All the games are divided into two parts, the original campaign for each game and expansion and the toolsets for creators which allow for the creation of modules and Dungeon Master Mode allowing players to recreate the pen and paper role-playing experience.</p><p>The first game's campaign begins with a new hero who has been called to Neverwinter Academy in order to help with the problems with the plague affecting the city. That is eventually driven off with your help but you soon find that other things are afoot and set off on a quest to set things right around the Northern sword coast. One of the biggest criticisms of the original game was that this campaign was underwhelming, and it was especially knocked for not having a party which you could control limiting your single player experience to just the player character and a AI-controlled henchman.</p><p>The first game's <a href=\"/expansion/3015-344/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-344\">expansions</a>, both <a href=\"/neverwinter-nights-shadows-of-undrentide/3030-16534/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16534\">Shadows of Undrentide</a> and <a href=\"/neverwinter-nights-hordes-of-the-underdark/3030-4452/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4452\">Hordes of the Underdark</a> began with a new character and took place away from the city of <a href=\"/neverwinter/3035-409/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-409\">Neverwinter</a>. Shadows of Undrentide began with you having to chase <a href=\"/bandit/3015-3588/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3588\">raiders</a> who attacked your village where you were learning to be a <a href=\"/heroes/3015-315/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-315\">hero</a> from a great adventurer who had retired there. This led into the second expansion Hordes of the Underdark where the <a href=\"/dark-elves/3015-2088/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2088\">Drow</a> are attacking the city of Waterdeep and you have to go stop them. Predictably there is more going on here than at first meets the eye. In Hordes of the Underdark you're given a party of two henchmen, of four to choose from in your adventures.</p><p>After this the series changed developers from Bioware to Obsidian. <a href=\"/neverwinter-nights-2/3030-9061/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9061\">Neverwinter Nights 2</a> starts yet another adventure, with a new graphical coat of paint. Here they aimed to fix the biggest complaint about the original games by giving the player a party of four, just large enough for the classic <a href=\"/fighter/3015-2648/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2648\">fighter</a>, <a href=\"/rogues/3015-1460/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1460\">thief</a>, <a href=\"/wizards/3015-1694/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1694\">mage</a>, <a href=\"/priest/3015-2496/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2496\">priest</a> D&amp;D party. However much the campaign was criticized as being incredibly generic and the player interactions were not up to par with other great RPGs. Many of the characters were seen as very generic, grumpy <a href=\"/dwarves/3015-940/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-940\">dwarves</a> and aloof <a href=\"/elf/3015-537/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-537\">elves</a> and the romantic relationships in the game were incredibly forced and unfinished feeling.</p><p><a href=\"/neverwinter-nights-2-mask-of-the-betrayer/3030-8763/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8763\">Mask of the Betrayer</a> is the final game in the series released so far which picks up where NWN2 left off, with the main character separated from his former companions and waking up far to the East in the lands of Rasheman. This game was widely praised for having the most unique story amongst all the Neverwinter Nights games and had a peculiar supporting cast of characters including a Thayvian Wizard, a Beargod and a Celestial and featured extremely high level powers and a unique spirit mechanic which forced the player to not dawdle.</p><h2>Cryptic Studios MMO</h2><p><a href=\"/cryptic-studios/3010-3766/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-3766\">Cryptic Studios</a> is developing a new MMORPG titled <a href=\"/neverwinter/3030-32417/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-32417\">Neverwinter</a>, set in an updated version of the titular city and using the D&amp;D 4th Edition rules.

The series is characterized by an arcade approach to the racing genre, often featuring police chases, street-style car customization and humorous, over-the-top characters. From <em>Need for Speed</em>'s <a href=\"/need-for-speed-ii/3030-367/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-367\">second iteration</a> in 1997 until 2013, the series has seen new releases every year (<a href=\"/motor-city-online/3030-12619/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12619\">except 2001</a>), usually aimed at the holiday period, reflecting the game's broad popularity. However, when the franchise was taken over by <a href=\"/ghost-games/3010-8437/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-8437\">Ghost Games</a> in 2013 (with the release of <a href=\"/need-for-speed-rivals/3030-42584/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-42584\"><em>Need for Speed Rivals</em></a>), new games in the series are now released biennially in odd-numbered years. Although at least 150 million copies of <em>NFS</em> games have been sold, making it the best-selling racing game franchise to date, it has seen multiple changes throughout the years and no less than three reboots. As of 2020, <a href=\"/criterion-games/3010-315/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-315\">Criterion Games</a>, the developers of the <a href=\"/burnout/3025-76/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-76\"><em>Burnout</em></a> franchise and two <em>NFS</em> entries, are the franchise's current primary developers.</p><p>The first era of <em>Need for Speed</em>, consisting of the first six entries in the franchise, followed a simple premise; to give players the opportunity to race some of the world's most exotic sports cars in a variety of scenic environments. With the exceptions of <a href=\"/need-for-speed-ii/3030-367/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-367\"><em>Need for Speed II</em></a> and the Porsche-focused <a href=\"/need-for-speed-porsche-unleashed/3030-8831/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8831\"><em>Need for Speed: Porsche Unleashed</em></a>, the games often involved police chases to spice up the action. <a href=\"/need-for-speed-iii-hot-pursuit/3030-5977/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5977\"><em>Need for Speed III: Hot Pursuit</em></a> (along with <a href=\"/need-for-speed-high-stakes/3030-453/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-453\"><em>Need for Speed: High Stakes</em></a> and <a href=\"/need-for-speed-hot-pursuit-2/3030-12395/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12395\"><em>Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2</em></a>) also allowed players to play as the cops stopping the racers; <em>III</em> even began <a href=\"/need-for-speed-hot-pursuit/3025-1820/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1820\">a popular sub-series of <em>NFS </em>entries</a> focusing heavily on the police pursuits.</p><p>However, in 2001, Universal Studios released the hit action film <em>The Fast and the Furious</em>, which brought the import tuner culture to mainstream audiences. Looking at the success of the film, EA had <a href=\"/ea-black-box/3010-1639/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1639\">Black Box</a>, the developers of the <a href=\"/playstation-2/3045-19/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-19\">PlayStation 2</a> version of <em>Hot Pursuit 2</em>, make a new <em>NFS</em> entry that focused on the underground street racing scene of tuners and aftermarket customization rather than exotics and sports cars. The result was 2003's hugely popular <a href=\"/need-for-speed-underground/3030-12254/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12254\"><em>Need for Speed: Underground</em></a>, which became the most commercially successful entry in the franchise and started a new era of <em>NFS</em> games focusing on tuners. An <a href=\"/open-world/3015-207/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-207\">open world</a> <a href=\"/need-for-speed-underground-2/3030-9651/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9651\">sequel</a> was released the following year to similar success, although the lack of police in both entries were also criticized. As a result, in 2005, EA Black Box released <em>Need for Speed: Most Wanted</em>, which reintroduced cop chases to the franchise and integrated them to the open world environment, which also brought back sports cars and exotics and was now set in the day again (after the endless nights of the <em>Underground</em> games). <em>Most Wanted</em> also became infamous for its story and acting (\"Five grand... FIVE GRAND!\"). Nevertheless, the franchise's ninth entry sold 16 million copies, becoming the biggest-selling entry in the series. <em>Most Wanted</em>'s sequel, <a href=\"/need-for-speed-carbon/3030-8844/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8844\"><em>Carbon</em></a>, released the following year, improving the car customization and returning to endless nighttime, while introducing a crew system and maintaining the police chases from the previous entry.</p><p>In 2007, <em><a href=\"/need-for-speed-prostreet/3030-18095/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18095\">Need for Speed: ProStreet</a></em> was released to mixed reception. It was criticized for its departure from the popular underground street racing themes of earlier incarnations. This prompted reassurances of a return to the series' roots for the 2008 release, <em><a href=\"/need-for-speed-undercover/3030-20741/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20741\">Undercover</a></em>. This was met with underwhelming reviews as the series tried to go back to a formula similar to <em>Most Wanted</em>. This prompted EA to remove Black Box as <em>Need for Speed</em>'s main developer and give the franchise another reboot. In 2009, they released two different games; sim racing-focused <a href=\"/need-for-speed-shift/3030-25225/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-25225\"><em>Need for Speed: Shift</em></a> for Xbox 360, <a href=\"/playstation-3/3045-35/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-35\">PlayStation 3</a>, and <a href=\"/pc/3045-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a>, and the cartoony <a href=\"/need-for-speed-nitro/3030-25227/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-25227\"><em>Need for Speed: Nitro</em></a> for <a href=\"/nintendo-ds/3045-52/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-52\">Nintendo DS</a> and <a href=\"/wii/3045-36/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-36\">Wii</a>. Black Box continued to work on a different entry, however, releasing the free-to-play racing MMO <a href=\"/need-for-speed-world/3030-25226/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-25226\"><em>Need for Speed: World</em></a> for PC in July 2010. <em>World</em> combined the maps of <em>Need for Speed: Most Wanted</em> and <em>Carbon</em> and kept the car customization focus from Black Box's earlier entries. Despite receiving twenty million registered users by November 2012, <em>World</em> ultimately failed to impress most critics. The game was shut down July 14, 2015 alongside three other free-to-play EA titles.</p><p>A highly anticipated <em>Need for Speed</em> title by <em>Burnout</em> developers Criterion Games was revealed as <em><a href=\"/need-for-speed-hot-pursuit/3030-31698/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-31698\">Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit</a></em> at EA's press conference at E3 2010. The reboot of the <em>Hot Pursuit</em> series returned the franchise's original focus on exotics and sports cars being chased by the cops (which players can play as) in a fantastic environment not seen in the <em>NFS</em> franchise since <em>Hot Pursuit 2</em>. The game also introduced a social racing component called <a href=\"/autolog/3015-7018/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7018\">Autolog</a>, which allow players to asynchronously compete with their friends for the best times in races and events. It released on November 16, 2010 to critical acclaim, winning several racing game of the year awards, with Autolog being a part of every subsequent <em>NFS</em> installment since. In 2011, a sequel to <em>Need for Speed: Shift</em> titled <a href=\"/shift-2-unleashed/3030-32253/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-32253\"><em>Shift 2: Unleashed</em></a> (which strangely did not carry the <em>Need for Speed</em> title despite still being part of the franchise), was released to better reception that the first <em>Shift</em>. Later that year, <em><a href=\"/need-for-speed-the-run/3030-34943/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-34943\">Need for Speed: The Run</a></em> was released. The first <em>NFS</em> game to feature on-foot segments, it was EA Black Box's attempt to take back control of the franchise. However, the game disappointed in sales and critical reception, which led to layoffs at the studio in 2012. The studio was renamed Quicklime Games that year to continue focusing on developing <em>Need for Speed: World</em>, and were eventually shut down in April 2013.</p><p>In 2012, EA announced that Criterion Games were developing another reimagining of a beloved entry in the series with their own take on <a href=\"/need-for-speed-most-wanted/3030-38497/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-38497\"><em>Need for Speed: Most Wanted</em></a>. A more socially-focused take on the original 2005 <em>Most Wanted</em>, the game was seen more as a spiritual successor to Criterion's 2008 smash hit <a href=\"/burnout-paradise/3030-5648/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5648\"><em>Burnout Paradise</em></a> and featured a revamped Autolog system. The game was released to positive critical reception, but polarizing fan reception, with many players of the first <em>Most Wanted</em> expressing displeasure on how different it was compared to the original. After <em>Most Wanted</em> and before the launch of Sony and Microsoft's respective eighth generation consoles the <a href=\"/playstation-4/3045-146/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-146\">PlayStation 4</a> and the <a href=\"/xbox-one/3045-145/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-145\">Xbox One</a>, EA assigned then-new development studio <a href=\"/ghost-games/3010-8437/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-8437\">Ghost Games</a> (originally founded as EA Gothenburg) to develop the next entry and take over development of the franchise. In 2013, the developer released their first game <em>Need for Speed Rivals</em>, which was developed with assistance from Criterion and was essentially an open world follow-up to Criterion's 2010 <em>Hot Pursuit</em>. However, in 2014, EA decided that they would not release any new <em>Need for Speed</em> game, although they did release a <em>Complete Edition</em> of <em>Rivals</em> and a film adaption that starred Aaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman of <em>Breaking Bad</em> fame) during the year. Instead, EA decided to reboot the franchise once again, this time with a return to the import tuner scene.</p><p>In 2015, EA released two entries to the franchise; an original free-to-play mobile entry developed by <a href=\"/firemonkeys/3010-8452/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-8452\">Firemonkeys Studios</a> called <a href=\"/need-for-speed-no-limits/3030-51194/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-51194\"><em>Need for Speed: No Limits</em></a> (which also replaced <em>Need for Speed: World</em> that, as aforementioned, was closed that same year), and the subtitle free <a href=\"/need-for-speed-2015-working-title/3030-49598/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-49598\"><em>Need for Speed</em></a> developed by Ghost Games. <em>No Limits</em> features quick racing events and receives regular content updates. The 2015 subtitleless reboot featured photorealistic visuals and <a href=\"/full-motion-video/3015-604/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-604\">full motion video</a> cutscenes, along with a free post-release update system called the \"Living Game\". The reboot received mixed reception, with criticism going towards the game's always online requirements and <a href=\"/rubber-band-ai/3015-35/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-35\">rubber band AI</a>. It was also criticized for lacking manual transmission and drag races, although they were later added in updates. The mixed reception caused EA and Ghost Games to delay the next entry in the series to 2017. That year, they released <a href=\"/need-for-speed-payback/3030-53691/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-53691\"><em>Need for Speed Payback</em></a>, which featured offline single-player and a story inspired by action driving films, most notably the more recent <em>Fast &amp; Furious</em> films. However, <em>Payback</em>, as well as <a href=\"/star-wars-battlefront-ii/3030-53692/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-53692\"><em>Star Wars Battlefront II</em></a> (which got more mainstream attention), received heavy criticism for their <a href=\"/loot-boxes/3015-9059/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-9059\">loot box</a> mechanics. No new <em>Need for Speed</em> title was released in 2018, although <em>Payback</em> received a large number of updates and <em>No Limits</em> continues to be supported.</p><p>In November 2019, during the franchise's twenty-fifth anniversary year, EA and Ghost Games released <a href=\"/need-for-speed-heat/3030-73586/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-73586\"><em>Need for Speed Heat</em></a>. Taking place in the <a href=\"/miami/3035-787/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-787\">Miami</a>-inspired Palm City, <em>Heat</em> took away the derided loot boxes and replaced the randomized upgrade system of <em>Payback</em> with a simpler, yet flexible one. The game also featured a unique day-and-night system, where during the day, players can earn \"Bank\" (the franchise's increasingly outdated term for its in-game currency) through legally sanctioned events held by the Speedhunters Showdown, which appears to be inspired by the Horizon Festival of the <a href=\"/forza-horizon/3025-4463/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-4463\"><em>Forza Horizon</em></a> series that became wildly successful with critics and racing game fans during the 2010s decade. When players decide to switch to night, they instead compete in illegal street races to earn \"Rep\", the game's experience points system. Players have to switch between the two to progress; they must earn \"Bank\" in the day to buy cars and upgrades, and earn \"Rep\" at night to level up in order to unlock new cars and upgrades. The police, represented by the Palm City Police Department, also behave differently between day and night. At day, cops are more civilized, will only chase the player if they collide with their car, enforce smaller speeding fines, and will only use basic police chase tactics to stop racers if they resist. At night, however, they become much more aggressive, with the PCPD's corrupt and seemingly sadistic task force using whatever they have at their disposal to take street racers down. While <em>Heat</em> still received overall mixed reception, it has been generally seen overall as a step in the right direction for the franchise to eventually return to its former glory.</p><p>However, the relatively improved reception was not enough to save Ghost Games. In February 2020, EA announced that the <em>Need for Speed</em> license will be moved back to Criterion Games, and that Ghost themselves will be reduced to a support studio focusing on the Frostbite engine, with the developer getting renamed back to its original name of EA Gothenburg. It remains to be seen how the franchise will proceed for the upcoming ninth generation consoles, the <a href=\"/playstation-5/3045-176/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-176\">PlayStation 5</a> and the <a href=\"/xbox-series-xs/3045-179/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-179\">Xbox Series X|S</a>, now that it has returned to the former <em>Burnout</em> studio. Criterion has announced that the June 2020 update for <em>Heat</em>, which adds cross-platform multiplayer to the game (making it the first EA game to have the feature), is the game's final update, leading to fan criticism that they were abandoning <em>Heat</em> too early after just one major content update in March that year. In November 2020, they released <a href=\"/need-for-speed-hot-pursuit/3030-31698/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-31698\"><em>Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit Remastered</em></a>, a remaster of their 2010 game containing all previously released DLC and featuring several improvements, including custom colors for most Racer vehicles, for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch (making it the first <em>NFS</em> game on a Nintendo console since <a href=\"/need-for-speed-most-wanted/3030-38497/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-38497\"><em>Most Wanted U</em></a> on the <a href=\"/wii-u/3045-139/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-139\">Wii U</a> in 2013), and PC (which finally got all the console DLC for the first time).</p><p>A new proper entry is currently in development, with subtle marketing from the <em>Hot Pursuit Remastered</em> release trailer and certain file names on the official <em>Need for Speed</em> website implying that it could be called <em>Need for Speed 5-10</em> (or <em>510</em>). However, on March 1, 2021, EA announced that the next <em>NFS</em> title would be delayed to 2022 so that Criterion would help <a href=\"/dice/3010-4880/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-4880\">DICE</a> finish the next <a href=\"/battlefield/3025-51/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-51\"><em>Battlefield</em></a> game.</p>", "guid": "3025-483", "name": "Need for Speed"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-484", "name": "NCAA March Madness"}, {"description": "<h2>Overview</h2>", "guid": "3025-485", "name": "NCAA Football"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-486", "name": "NCAA College Hoops 2K"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-487", "name": "NCAA College Football 2K"}, {"description": "<p>The Lumines franchise first made it's debut on the launch of the <a data-ref-id=\"3010-3223\" href=\"/sony-corporation/3010-3223/\" slug=\"sony-corporation\">  Sony</a> <a data-ref-id=\"3045-18\" href=\"/psp/3045-18/\" slug=\"psp\"> PSP</a> in Japan on December 12, 2004, and quickly became known for its unique twist on the puzzle genre.

It was created in 1993, and continues to be a popular game even today. Wizards of the Coast commonly releases one new \"block\" of cards every year, which usually consists of three \"sets\" containing 100-250 cards. They also release an update to the \"core\" set, which includes new cards and reprints of old cards with new art or updated rules. In the Stardard tournament format, the two most recent core sets, and two most recent blocks are legally playable. Other tournament formats allow four blocks and two base sets (Extended), cards released after 8th Edition and the Mirrodin set (Modern), and some allow almost all cards ever released (Legacy and Vintage). Many hobby stores that sell magic cards also have weekly magic tournaments, such as booster drafts and Friday Night Magic.</p><p>Magic the Gathering is a Worldwide hobby with millions playing the game in over 70 countries.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14906/469590-mtg_collection.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-469590\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.775\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:77.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14906/469590-mtg_collection.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-469590\"><img alt=\"Magic: the Gathering Online\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/14906/469590-mtg_collection.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/14906/469590-mtg_collection.jpg 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1/14906/469590-mtg_collection.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/14906/469590-mtg_collection.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Magic: the Gathering Online</figcaption></figure><p>The translation from card game to video game has had mixed results. Magic: the Gathering Online offers an interesting conundrum in that you purchase cards online and have them online only to play, but can only get them sent to you if you have one card from every set. So a gamer must weigh the risks of sinking money into an online game that may not always be there, but has the ability to play with anyone anytime against owning physical cards that can degrade if not protected well, and not having as much of a chance to play with people. Magic Online has been very successful for Wizards of the Coast, and represents almost 40% of Magic: the Gathering's total revenue. There have been several console releases, including <a data-ref-id=\"3030-18824\" href=\"/magic-the-gathering-battlemage/3030-18824/\" slug=\"magic-the-gathering-battlemage\">Magic the Gathering Battlemage</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-18567\" href=\"/magic-the-gathering-battlegrounds/3030-18567/\" slug=\"magic-the-gathering-battlegrounds\">Magic the Gathering: Battlegrounds</a>, which have had limited success. <a data-ref-id=\"3030-23609\" href=\"/magic-the-gathering-duels-of-the-planeswalkers/3030-23609/\" slug=\"magic-the-gathering-duels-of-the-planeswalkers\">Magic The Gathering: Duels of the Planeswalkers</a> was released for the Xbox 360 on the Xbox Live Arcade on June 17th, 2009. It has been well-received, being downloaded over 440,000 times with over 170,000 full game purchases.</p><h2><b>Basic Rules</b></h2><ul><li>Each player begins with 20 life.</li><li>The most basic type of card is land, which can be played for no cost, but only one can be played per turn.</li><li>All other cards are played using mana, which is created by land. There are five basic land types, which correspond to the five colors of mana. Swamps/Black, Mountains/Red, Plains/White, Forests/Green, and Islands/Blue.</li><li>Creatures and other spells can be used to damage your opponent, reducing their life total.</li><li>A player wins when their opponent(s) are down to zero life, or have no more cards left in their deck. A player also loses if they are given 10 poison counters, such as from creatures with the Infect ability.</li></ul><h2>Card Types</h2><ul><li>Creatures: Cards that remain on the battlefield that can attack and defend. They may also have extra abilities that can be activated in specific ways.</li><li>Sorcery and Instants: Cards that can do any number of things such as deal damage to another player or their creatures or allow you to gain life. These do not remain on the battlefield, and usually have a one-time effect.</li><li>Enchantments: Cards that remain on the battlefield that are activated when a certain action is taken.</li><li>Artifacts: Similar to enchantments, they are cards that remain on the battlefield. Sometimes they are activated with certain actions, other times they can be 'equipped' to creature cards giving them certain abilities.</li><li>Planeswalkers: Cards that represent powerful characters from the storyline whom you summon to assist you. Planewalkers have powerful abilities, making almost all of these cards highly sought-after.</li></ul><h2>Play Areas</h2><ul><li>Hand: Each player has a hand, which contains cards that he may play. The maximum hand size is seven cards, and any excess cards must be discarded at the end of a player's turn.</li><li>Library: The deck of cards, face down, that the player has not yet drawn. If a player's library is depleted, they are out of the game.</li><li>Battlefield: This contains all cards that are currently \"in play.\"</li><li>Graveyard: When cards must be discarded, creatures are destroyed, or sorceries and abilities are cast, they go to the graveyard. It is basically the player's discard pile.</li><li>Exile: Previously known as \"removed from the game,\" the Exile zone contains cards that have been specifically removed from the game and not placed in the graveyard.</li></ul><h2>Parts of a Turn</h2><p>The turn consists of five phases, some with multiple steps to the phase. Some steps or phases require the player to do something, like draw a card during the draw step. Others may not require any action by the player, but may trigger effects on certain cards.</p><h3>Beginning Phase</h3><ul><li><b>Untap</b> - the player may \"untap\" all cards that they currently have \"tapped\". Creatures become tapped when they attack, and many other cards may be tapped to activate abilities.</li><li><b>Upkeep</b> - no action required by the player, but many abilities are triggered during this step.</li><li><b>Draw</b> - the player must draw a card from his deck. If he has no cards left, he is out of the game.</li></ul><h3>First Main Phase</h3><p>The player may play any available cards during this phase. The two main phases are the only time when you can cast sorceries, or put land, creatures, artifacts, and enchantments into play.</p><h3>Combat Phase</h3><ul><li><b>Beginning of Combat</b> - during this step, the attacking and defending players may cast instants or use abilities to prepare for combat.</li><li><b>Declare Attackers</b> - the attacking player must declare all creatures that he will be attacking with. Tapped creatures are not allowed to attack.</li><li><b>Declare Blockers</b> - similar to the declare attackers phase, except the defending player must declare all creatures that he will block with. Tapped creatures are not allowed to block.</li><li><b>Combat Damage</b> - all combat damage is dealt concurrently. Attacking creatures deal damage to blocking creatures, and blocking creatures deal damage to attacking creatures. Any unblocked creatures deal damage to the player, reducing his life total.</li><li><b>End of Combat</b> - similar to beginning of combat. No actions are required, but players may play instants and abilities may be triggered.</li></ul><h3>Second Main Phase</h3><p>Identical to the first main phase. The player may cast sorceries, or play creatures, artifacts, and enchantments.</p><h3>End Phase</h3><ul><li><b>End</b> - this is the last chance players have to cast instants or activate abilities during the current player's turn.</li><li><b>Cleanup</b> - All effects that last until the \"end of turn\" wear off, and the current player's turn ends.</li></ul>", "guid": "3025-493", "name": "Magic: The Gathering"}, {"description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>NBA Live is Electronic Sports basketball franchise.</p><h2>NBA Live Cover Athletes </h2><p>2010 Dwight Howard (Orlando Magic)</p><p>2009 Tony Parker (San Antonio Spurs)</p><p>2008 Gilbert Arenas (Washington Wizards)</p><p>2007 Tracy McGrady (Houston Rockets)</p><p>2006 Dwayne Wade (Miami Heat)</p><p>2005 Carmelo Anthony (Denver Nuggets)</p><p>2004 Vince Carter (Toronto Raptors)</p><p>2003 Jason Kidd (New Jersey Nets)</p><p>2002 Steve Francis (Houston Rockets)</p><p>2001 Kevin Garnett (Minnesota Timberwolves)</p><p>2000 Tim Duncan (San Antonio Spurs)</p><p>1999 Antoine Walker (Boston Celtics)</p><p>1998 Tim Hardaway (Miami Heat)</p><p>1997 Mitch Richmond (Sacramento Kings)</p>", "guid": "3025-494", "name": "NBA Live"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-495", "name": "NBA In the Zone"}, {"description": "<br/>", "guid": "3025-497", "name": "NBA Ballers"}, {"description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>NBA 2K is a basketball franchise created by Visual Concepts and was made when EA would not publish its sports franchises on the Sega Dreamcast.

The series has had 14 games in the franchise (17 including 3 Japanese arcade ports of the series.), with every game in the franchise prior to Mario Party 9 being developed by <a href=\"/hudson-entertainment-inc/3010-419/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-419\">Hudson Soft</a> (Except for the 3 Japanese arcade ports, which is developed by <a href=\"/capcom/3010-367/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-367\">Capcom</a>). Subsequent development of the series was taken over by <a href=\"/ndcube-co-ltd/3010-91/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-91\">NDCube</a>, a Nintendo subsidiary which houses several former Hudson developers. Naturally, every game has been published by <a href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-90\">Nintendo</a> as well. The first game in the franchise, <a href=\"/mario-party/3030-6424/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6424\">Mario Party</a>, came out for the <a href=\"/nintendo-64/3045-43/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-43\">Nintendo 64</a> in December of 1998, and since has had nearly yearly installments in the series.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Despite being a very popular and multi-million selling franchise (with nearly every game in the series selling well over a million copies), critics tend to agree that the games have been declining in quality. While the first few games were well received for their easy to pick up gameplay, later installments have been criticized for not differing enough from their predecessors.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Each game in the franchise has small differences, but the general standards tend to stay the same from game to game. Every game takes place on a variety of \"boards,\" where several human or computer controlled players can collect items, coins, and stars. The ultimate goal is to collect the most stars by the end of the game. There are a variety of ways to do this, usually by purchasing them or winning them.</p><h3>Minigames</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><a href=\"/minigames/3015-116/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-116\">Minigames</a> are some of what Mario Party is most well known for. Every game has had nearly 50-100 minigames (excluding <a href=\"/mario-party-e/3030-14770/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14770\">Mario Party-e</a>), with several variations of the minigames. Coins are dealt out to the top players for each minigame, and the top teams for team based minigames. Some Mario Party games introduce new types of minigames, from <a href=\"/donkey-kong/3005-299/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-299\">Donkey Kong</a> minigames, to duel minigames.</p><h2>Features</h2><h3>Mario Party</h3><figure style=\"width: 620px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2338/183539-mario_party_3__u_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-183539\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.7\" data-width=\"620\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2338/183539-mario_party_3__u_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-183539\"><img alt=\"Mario Party\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/2338/183539-mario_party_3__u_.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/2338/183539-mario_party_3__u_.jpg 620w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/2338/183539-mario_party_3__u_.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/2338/183539-mario_party_3__u_.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Mario Party</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The original <a href=\"/mario-party/3030-6424/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6424\">Mario Party</a> introduced many of the series' standards outlined above. The game had 53 minigames, and was released for the Nintendo 64 on February 8, 1999 (in North America). Mario Party had six playable characters, and those characters have returned in every Mario Party game since (excluding <a href=\"/mario-party-advance/3030-5995/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5995\">Mario Party Advance</a>, in which <a href=\"/wario/3005-24/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-24\">Wario</a> was absent).</p><h3>Mario Party 2</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><a href=\"/mario-party-2/3030-12162/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12162\">Mario Party 2</a> was released for the Nintendo 64 on January 24, 2000 (in North America). The second game introduced items, which have been included in every game to date. It also introduced duel and battle minigames. Battle minigames are similar to four player minigames, but each player contributed to the winnings, instead of the winners winning a set amount of coins. Duel minigames are one-on-one minigames where two players face off against each other.</p><h3>Mario Party 3</h3><figure style=\"width: 320px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/697982-mario_party_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-697982\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.696875\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:69.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/697982-mario_party_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-697982\"><img alt=\"Mario Party 3\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/697982-mario_party_3.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/697982-mario_party_3.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Mario Party 3\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/697982-mario_party_3.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/697982-mario_party_3.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Mario Party 3</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><a href=\"/mario-party-3/3030-12447/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12447\">Mario Party 3</a> was the last Mario Party game released for the Nintendo 64 (released on May 7, 2001). The game introduced the story mode to the franchise, allowing one player to play against computer controlled opponents while collecting \"stamps.\" Similar story modes have appeared in every Mario Party game since. Game Guy minigames are also introduced in Mario Party 3. Upon landing on the Game Guy space, players forfeit all of their coins and play a game of chance. If they win, their total coins are multiplied (usually doubled). These did not appear in any other Mario Party game.</p><h3>Mario Party 4</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The first Mario Party game to be released for the <a href=\"/gamecube/3045-23/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-23\">Nintendo GameCube</a>, <a href=\"/mario-party-4/3030-4660/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4660\">Mario Party 4</a> came out on October 21, 2002 (in North America). The game removed duel minigames in multiplayer, but during the single player story all minigames are \"duel minigames.\" It also introduced <a href=\"/bowser/3005-337/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-337\">Bowser</a> minigames, which are usually more difficult and have outrageous requirements for the loser (e.g. forfeiting all of their coins).</p><h3>Mario Party 5</h3><figure style=\"width: 281px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4344/650834-mario_party_5_box_art.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-650834\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.423487544484\" data-width=\"281\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:142.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4344/650834-mario_party_5_box_art.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-650834\"><img alt=\"Mario Party 5\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px\" data-width=\"281\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/4344/650834-mario_party_5_box_art.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/4344/650834-mario_party_5_box_art.jpg 281w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Mario Party 5\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/4344/650834-mario_party_5_box_art.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/4344/650834-mario_party_5_box_art.jpg 281w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px\" data-width=\"281\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Mario Party 5</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><a href=\"/mario-party-5/3030-3410/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3410\">Mario Party 5</a> came out originally for the GameCube on November 10, 2003 (in North America), and was later ported to Japanese arcades under the name Super Mario Fushigi no Korokoro Party Super Mario: The Mysterious Rolling Party (and was the only game not to be developed by Hudson Soft, instead developed by <a href=\"/capcom/3010-367/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-367\">Capcom</a>). The GameCube version re-introduced the duel minigames, and introduced a mode known as Super-Duel Mode, where players could create their own combat vehicle and then battle with other players.

This edition saw some major changes to the game's rules. All players now share a single vehicle and move around the board together. The game boards are no longer cyclical; each board is linear and features a boss battle minigame at the end. The star system was also revamped, with coins and stars replaced by a single currency of mini stars.</p><h3>Mario Party 10</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><a href=\"/mario-party-10/3030-46586/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-46586\">Mario Party 10</a> was released in 2015 for the <a href=\"/wii-u/3045-139/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-139\">Wii U</a>.

While the games can be considered traditional in that they are turn-based RPGs featuring familiar concepts such as persistent character growth, they also contain elements that separate them from many of their contemporaries; these elements are primarily derived from both the Mushroom Kingdom setting as well as the gameplay conventions of traditional Mario games. For example, every Mario RPG game contains some form of <a href=\"/platforming/3015-2258/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2258\">platforming</a>. The turn-based combat present in these games is also slightly modified from more established RPG fare through the extensive use of timed button presses to increase the effectiveness of actions, short minigames to activate attacks, or sometimes both in tandem.</p><p>The Mario RPG games are also well-known for their humor.
