A fleeing electromagnetic (EM) alien collides with Geo, and since Geo wore special glasses (called a Visualizer) he could see the alien. The alien calls himself Omega-Xis (or Mega for short) and forces Geo to take care of him as a refugee, claiming that he knows something about the fate of Geo's dad. Through EM Wave Change, the two fuse to become the EM Warrior Megaman, and the two strive to defeat the evil coming their way.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Star Force adopts a lot of things from the Battle Network series. As Geo, you could navigate in the real world and the Wave World (replacing the Net World of BN), fight viruses Wave Battle and take on extra side-quests either for fun or for goodies.</p><p>The battle system, however, is tweaked up a little. The battles are now presented in 3D using an over the shoulder perspective. However, Geo is only being able to move left and right. Megaman is able to lock-on to enemies, making close-range attacks like swords still effective. You use battle cards (replacing battle chips) or your trusty Mega Buster to wipe out the enemies on the screen.</p><p>A feature that isn't from BN is the BrotherBand. That's when 2 players form a connection to give up bonuses, such as extra HP or favorite battlecards of the partner. You can have up to 6 brothers. The games can be completed without using this feature at all. In fact, the games typically have an NPC character form a BrotherBand with you as part of the BrotherBand tutorial.</p><h2>Reception</h2><p>The Star Forces series has received a lot of criticism for two things: The borrowing of so many concepts from the Battle Network series and how little these concepts are changed. Other complaints also include lackluster graphics that identical to the Battle Network titles on Game Boy Advance titles. Certain reviews also cited the extremely high <a href=\"/random-encounter/3015-123/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-123\">randomly triggered encounter</a> rate as a flaw.</p><p>The series was been critically re-evaluated for having a good written story and for the enjoyable battle system.</p><h2>Main Releases</h2><p>Whereas Mega Man Battle Network spanned 6 titles (even more if you count spinoffs and remakes) there were only 3 Star Force games. The story was concluded with the third Star Force title which was released in USA in 2009 and the series has since gone dormant.</p><h3>Mega Man Star Force</h3><ul><li>USA Release: 2007</li><li>Platform: <a href=\"/nintendo-ds/3045-52/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-52\">Nintendo DS</a></li><li>3 versions: \"Dragon\", \"Leo\", and \"Pegasus\"</li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6673/466974-dragoncover.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-466974\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.88967971530249\" data-width=\"281\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 281px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:89.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6673/466974-dragoncover.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-466974\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px\" data-width=\"281\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/6673/466974-dragoncover.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/6673/466974-dragoncover.jpg 281w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/6673/466974-dragoncover.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/6673/466974-dragoncover.jpg 281w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px\" data-width=\"281\"></noscript></a></figure></td><td><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6673/466970-leocover.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-466970\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.88967971530249\" data-width=\"281\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 281px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:89.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6673/466970-leocover.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-466970\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px\" data-width=\"281\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/6673/466970-leocover.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/6673/466970-leocover.jpg 281w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/6673/466970-leocover.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/6673/466970-leocover.jpg 281w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px\" data-width=\"281\"></noscript></a></figure></td><td><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6673/466972-pegasuscover.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-466972\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.88967971530249\" data-width=\"281\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 281px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:89.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6673/466972-pegasuscover.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-466972\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px\" data-width=\"281\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/6673/466972-pegasuscover.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/6673/466972-pegasuscover.jpg 281w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/6673/466972-pegasuscover.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/6673/466972-pegasuscover.jpg 281w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px\" data-width=\"281\"></noscript></a></figure></td></tr></tbody></table><p>The debut of Mega Man Star Force which came in three variants.

Unlike developer Arika's previous Everblue games, this one uses a third person perspective, though a first person mode is used for examination and photography. The player also has access to a large aquarium populated by the different species they've found.</p><p>There are also different side missions, where the player has to act as a tour guide to visitors, these don't affect the course of the history. The soundtrack features several songs from soprano singer Hayley Westenra, but players can create a custom soundtrack by transfering their own MP3 music to an SD card. This is the second game on the Wii to provide this feature after Excite Truck.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14097/574626-forever25783__18_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-574626\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.54807692307692\" data-width=\"832\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 832px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:54.8%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14097/574626-forever25783__18_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-574626\"><img alt=\"The player explores the ocean\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/14097/574626-forever25783__18_.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/14097/574626-forever25783__18_.jpg 832w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/14097/574626-forever25783__18_.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/14097/574626-forever25783__18_.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>The player explores the ocean</figcaption></figure><h2>Endless Ocean: Blue World</h2><p>The sequel, Endless Ocean: Blue World was released on February 22, 2010 in North America.

As with the rest of the Mario &amp; Luigi franchise, Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga was developed by <a href=\"/alphadream-corporation-ltd/3010-4049/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-4049\">AlphaDream</a> and published by <a href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-90\">Nintendo</a>. The game followed the titular characters, <a href=\"/mario/3005-177/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-177\">Mario</a> and Luigi, on a quest to recover <a href=\"/princess-peach/3005-709/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-709\">Princess Peach</a>'s voice, as well as the Beanstar, from <a href=\"/cackletta/3005-7182/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-7182\">Cackletta</a>. This quest largely took place in the <a href=\"/beanbean-kingdom/3035-1610/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1610\">Beanbean Kingdom</a>, rather than the <a href=\"/the-mushroom-kingdom/3035-14/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-14\">Mushroom Kingdom</a>. The game was well-received by fans and critics alike, especially for the game's humor. The game's battle system also slightly differs from that of a traditional RPG, with more emphasis on timing and Bros. Moves (which are complicated maneuvers that Mario and Luigi can pull off).</p><h2>Mario &amp; Luigi: Partners in Time</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/876501-mlpit_logo.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-876501\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.58888888888889\" data-width=\"900\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 900px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:58.9%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/876501-mlpit_logo.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-876501\"><img alt=\"Mario &amp; Luigi: Partners in Time's logo.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/876501-mlpit_logo.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/876501-mlpit_logo.jpg 900w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/876501-mlpit_logo.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/876501-mlpit_logo.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Mario &amp; Luigi: Partners in Time's logo.</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/mario-luigi-partners-in-time/3030-15439/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15439\"> Mario &amp; Luigi: Partners in Time</a> (known as Mario &amp; Luigi RPG 2 in Japan) was released for the Nintendo DS on November 28, 2005 in North America, on December 29, 2005 in Japan, and on January 27, 2006 in Europe. Mario &amp; Luigi: Partners in Time featured the ability to play as <a href=\"/baby-mario/3005-2047/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2047\">Baby Mario</a> and <a href=\"/baby-luigi/3005-3556/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3556\">Baby Luigi</a> as well as their older versions.
