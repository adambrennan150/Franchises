The early, first-person-based entries in the series are notable for having almost no visible numerical stats; the amount of damage inflicted and received during battle is solely determined by the player character's spoken responses and facial expressions. The characters and setting of this series were used to create a puzzle spinoff named <a href=\"/puyo-puyo/3025-427/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-427\">Puyo Puyo</a>, which would go on to overtake the Madou Monogatari series in popularity. The two series were divorced following Compile's closure, after which no new Madou Monogatari games were developed until <a href=\"/sei-madou-monogatari/3030-40755/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-40755\">Sei Madou Monogatari</a> more than ten years later.</p><h2>History</h2><p>Madou Monogatari debuted in Compile's MSX2 demo-disk/disc-magazine hybrid \"Disc Station\" with the release of Madou Monogatari Episode II Carbuncle in December 1989. The following year saw the release of <a href=\"/madou-monogatari-1-2-3/3030-7925/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7925\">Madou Monogatari 1-2-3</a>, a 3-in-1 package of first-person dungeon-crawlers that chronicle the adventures of <a href=\"/arle-nadja/3005-14463/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14463\">Arle Nadja</a>. The game was ported to the NEC PC-98 in November 1991, mere weeks after the release of the first <a href=\"/puyo-puyo/3030-41081/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-41081\">Puyo Puyo</a>.</p><p>There were no new Madou Monogatari games created in 1992; instead, Compile partnered with <a href=\"/sega/3010-62/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-62\">Sega</a> to create <a href=\"/puyo-puyo/3030-1916/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1916\">an arcade game</a> based on Puyo Puyo. Madou Monogatari ARS, the second game in the Madou Monogatari series, was released in December 1993; additionally, Sega published ports of the three chapters of 1-2-3 on their Game Gear handheld.</p><p>Compile and Sega released <a href=\"/puyo-puyo-2/3030-4929/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4929\">Puyo Puyo Tsu</a>, the most successful game in that series, in 1994. After Tsu's success, Compile shifted its focus to Puyo Puyo; releases in the Madou Monogatari series were mostly limited to remakes/reimaginings of Madou Monogatari I and small games in the Windows 95 editions of the \"Disc Station\" magazine. However, Compile's future offerings did not perform well enough to compensate for the growth that it underwent following Tsu's success, and thus the company restructured in 1998. One final Madou game was released after this restructure: a traditional RPG simply titled <a href=\"/madou-monogatari/3030-773/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-773\">Madou Monogatari</a>.</p><p>Compile finally collapsed in 2002. Sega, who received the Madou Monogatari characters rights in the 1998 restructure, would purchase the rights to the Puyo Puyo series.

Intended to show off the system's superior graphical power, the actual gameplay tends to fall short in each case. Sega put out eleven core entries - Basketball, Ice Hockey, Volleyball, Football, Tennis, two Soccer, two Baseball and two Golf - as well as a special edition of Football and the second Soccer that used the system's Sports Pad peripheral. Great Ice Hockey also required the Sports Pad to play.</p><p>The first game in the series was the Japanese release of Great Soccer in 1985, which used the system's early card format. It was followed by the Japanese 1985 release of Great Baseball and Great Tennis. The others would appear throughout 1987, both in Japan and in the West. The last game to be released with the Great label was the second Great Soccer; specifically a special version compatible with the Sports Pad peripheral called Sports Pad Soccer in Japan.</p><p>Due to Sega's odd naming habit, there exists two Great Soccers - one is the Japanese original, which did not receive a US release, and the second is called World Soccer in Japan and Europe and Great Soccer in the US. Similarly, the first Great Golf is a Japan-exclusive game and its sequel is called Great Golf in the US and Europe but Masters Golf in its home territory. This is also the case with Great Baseball - the first is Japan-exclusive, the sequel is the world version of Great Baseball that is named The Pro Yakyuu: Pennant Race in Japan. It is thought that Sega wanted to maintain the naming convention in other territories in order to strengthen the brand name.</p><p>The US received eight of the eleven games - the exceptions being the first Great Golf, the first Great Baseball and the first Great Soccer.
