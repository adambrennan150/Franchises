The franchise began in 1996 with <a href=\"/shizuku/3030-69917/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-69917\">Shizuku</a> on the <a href=\"/nec-pc-9801/3045-112/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-112\">NEC PC-98</a> and was followed by <a href=\"/kizuato/3030-69918/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-69918\">Kizuato</a> the same year as well as <a href=\"/to-heart/3030-13207/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13207\">To Heart</a> in 1997. <a href=\"/routes/3030-70032/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-70032\">Routes</a> tried to revive the brand name in 2003 with a new development team and the PC release of <a href=\"/toheart2-xrated/3030-87322/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-87322\">To Heart 2</a> in 2005 was classified as the fifth volume in the series on certain pieces of product information [3]. However, outside of these two exceptions, the franchise has largely remained dormant after its original three installments.</p><h2>Influence</h2><p>The Leaf Visual Novel Series were \"novel type adventure games\" that contained branching stories, very reminiscent of <a href=\"/chunsoft/3010-988/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-988\">Chunsoft</a>'s <a href=\"/sound-novel/3025-2567/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-2567\">Sound Novel</a> franchise [4]. In fact, <a href=\"/tatsuya-takahashi/3040-178446/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-178446\">Tatsuya Takahashi</a> has stated that the Visual Novel Series began with the goal of creating a title similar to <a href=\"/banshee-s-last-cry/3030-28241/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-28241\">Kamaitachi no Yoru</a> for the Japanese PC market [2]. However, since Leaf's titles had a larger focus on visuals, and the term was copyrighted by Chunsoft, the development team decided to call their titles \"visual\" novels instead of \"sound\" novels. The release of Shizuku marked one of the very first times a video game had classified itself as a \"visual novel.\" This style of adventure game would eventually grow in popularity after the success of <a href=\"/to-heart/3030-13207/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13207\">To Heart</a>, which was later ported to consoles and spawned a multi-media <a href=\"/to-heart/3025-1851/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1851\">franchise</a> of its own.</p><p>Almost immediately, other companies began imitating Leaf's Visual Novel Series such as <a href=\"/tactics/3010-7258/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-7258\">Tactics</a>, a division within <a href=\"/nexton/3010-7341/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-7341\">Nexton</a> that would later split off to form <a href=\"/key/3010-3956/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-3956\">Key</a>. Another famous example is <a href=\"/type-moon/3010-6379/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6379\">Type-Moon</a> who's early titles, such as <a href=\"/tsukihime/3030-22348/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-22348\">Tsukihime</a> and <a href=\"/fatestay-night/3030-21726/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21726\">Fate/stay night</a>, took clear inspiration from the Leaf Visual Novel Series. The then doujin group even labeled their titles specifically as \"visual novels,\" which was uncommon at the time. While novel-style games grew in popularity, the term itself, \"visual novel,\" was almost never used by other Japanese companies outside of Leaf and was not even widely used by Japanese fans. However, the term took on a life of its own outside of Japan and now \"visual novel\" is often used to classify any kind of novel-style Japanese adventure game in the West and sometimes Japan itself.</p><h2>External Links</h2><ol><li><a href=\"http://bungle.cocolog-nifty.com/work/\" data-target=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Bungle Bungle</a> - The official website of <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/tatsuya-takahashi/3040-178446/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-178446\">Tatsuya Takahashi</a> and <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/tooru-minazuki/3040-178448/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-178448\">Tooru Minazuki</a>, creators of the Leaf Visual Novel Series.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.tinami.com/x/interview/04/\" data-target=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">TINAMIX INTERVIEW SPECIAL: Leaf's Tatsuya Takahashi &amp; Woodal Harada</a> (TinaMix, 2000).</li><li><a href=\"https://leaf.aquaplus.jp/product/th2x/product.html\" data-target=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">ToHeart2 XRATED Product Page</a> (Leaf).</li><li><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/19981206034820/http://leaf.nerv.ne.jp/seihin.html#toheart\" data-target=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Leaf Product Pamphlet</a> (Leaf, 1998) - Classifies the Leaf Visual Novel Series as \"novel type ADVs\".</li></ol>", "guid": "3025-4357", "name": "Leaf Visual Novel Series"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-4358", "name": "Dark Age of Camelot"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-4359", "name": "Imperivm"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-4360", "name": "Dead Frontier"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-4361", "name": "New York Mysteries"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-4362", "name": "Cookie Run"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-4363", "name": "Deadpool"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-4364", "name": "Xenoblade"}], "version": "1.0"}
