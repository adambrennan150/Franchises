However, the home console games have all featured dedicated multiplayer modes, often using a pass-the-controller format.</p><h2>Origins</h2><p>The concept of microgames began in <a href=\"/mario-artist-polygon-studio/3030-21204/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21204\">Mario Artist: Polygon Studio</a>, released for the <a href=\"/nintendo-64dd/3045-101/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-101\">Nintendo 64DD</a> addon in Japan. Players could create their own 3D polygon models and use them in a series of eight \"Sound Bomber\" games that were just 3 seconds long and got progressively harder, much like WarioWare's games. Those original games were adapted for the original GBA WarioWare, and the boombox motif used in that game is a callback to the Sound Bomber mode.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2104/962726-ww64dd.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-962726\" data-ratio=\"0.50187265917603\" data-width=\"801\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 801px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:50.2%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2104/962726-ww64dd.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-962726\"><img alt=\"The original Sound Bomber games...\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/2104/962726-ww64dd.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/2104/962726-ww64dd.jpg 801w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/2104/962726-ww64dd.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>The original Sound Bomber games...</figcaption></figure><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2104/962727-wwgba.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-962727\" data-ratio=\"0.4475\" data-width=\"800\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:44.8%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2104/962727-wwgba.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-962727\"><img alt=\"...and their WarioWare, Inc. counterparts.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/2104/962727-wwgba.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/2104/962727-wwgba.jpg 800w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/2104/962727-wwgba.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>...and their WarioWare, Inc. counterparts.</figcaption></figure><p> </p>", "guid": "3025-220", "name": "WarioWare"}, {"description": "<h2>Sub-franchises</h2><a data-ref-id=\"3025-600\" href=\"/wario-land/3025-600/\" slug=\"wario-land\">  Wario Land</a> | <a data-ref-id=\"3025-220\" href=\"/warioware/3025-220/\" slug=\"warioware\"> WarioWare</a> \u00a0 <br/><br/><h2>Overview</h2>The Wario franchise consists of all games that star <a data-ref-id=\"3005-24\" href=\"/wario/3005-24/\" slug=\"wario\">   Wario</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3010-90\" href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" slug=\"nintendo\">   Nintendo</a>'s \"rival\" for <a data-ref-id=\"3005-177\" href=\"/mario/3005-177/\" slug=\"mario\">   Mario</a>.

The Fungi provides a hard shell around the few vital organs they have, making them harder to kill, and naturally resistant to damage.</p><p>Orks are usually split up into clans, though there are only a few major clans, there are an uncountable number of smaller clans that are constantly being made and disbanded.</p><p>The Ork hierarchy is simple, depending simply on whoever is the biggest and the strongest. The more Orks fight and kill the larger they grow, so either the luckiest or the most skillful Ork would eventually rise to the top of the food chain in an Ork society.</p><p>Some Orks have information programmed into their DNA.

It was his foreknowledge of the birth of the Chaos God, Slaanesh, that led to his decision to take direct control of uniting and advancing the entire Human race from M15 onwards. Humanity has become the most numerous race in the galaxy; however, they are beset on all sides by a multitude of enemies: The four Chaos Gods and their millions of followers, Tyranids, mutants, Demons, Eldar, Tau, heretics, Dark Eldar, Orks, rouge psykers, and most recently, Necrons.</p><h2>Timeline</h2><h3>60,000,000 BC</h3><p>The Necrontyr and the Old Ones.</p><p>The Necrontyr were losing the ancient war they were waging with the Old Ones, mainly due to the Old Ones' hugely powerful psychic abilities and more advanced technology, they contact the intelligent energy beings called the C'tan for aid. In turn, the C'tan have the Necrontyr create exoskeletons for them from the living metal called necrodermis so that they can interact with solid matter. The C'tan also trick the Necrontyr into transferring their own consciousnesses into robotic bodies created from necrodermis which ultimately results in their becoming the C'tan's new race of non-sentient slaves called the Necrons. The newly-created Necrons then purge almost all life from the Milky Way in order to feed the C'tan.</p><h3>8,000 BC</h3><p>Birth of the future God-Emperor of Mankind.</p><p>Somewhere in central Anatolia (<a href=\"/turkey/3035-1356/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1356\">Turkey</a>, as it is known today) after all the known shamans of the Earth (those few members of humanity blessed with psychic abilities at this point in mankind's history) collectively commit suicide and combine their life energies within the Warp into a single soul that is reincarnated in the body of one extraordinary human being, the most potent psyker in the Milky Way galaxy, who will also prove to be immortal and thus the leader of the Imperium of Man.</p><h3>8,000 BC to 1,400 AD</h3><p>Birth of the Ruinous Powers aka Chaos.</p><p>These entities, colloquially called the Chaos Gods, were created and empowered by the collective psychic imprint of humanity and the other intelligent races of the Milky Way galaxy on the once tranquil Immaterium, transforming it into the daemon-haunted nightmare that is the Warp of today. They are the manifest forms of negative energy that has been accumulated over the tens of thousands of years of sentient life roaming the galaxy.</p><h3>1 AD to 14,000 AD</h3><p>The Age of Terra aka the Age of Progress</p><p>Humanity advanced from a pre-industrial Iron Age culture to become a star-spanning civilization. During the long years of the Age of Terra, humanity comes to dominate the Earth culturally and technologically; eventually the Solar System is colonised once the necessary inter-planetary transportation and terraforming technology is developed early on in the 3rd Millennium.</p><p>Mankind moves on to colonise Mars and then the moons of Jupiter, Saturn and Neptune; advanced fusion and anti-matter propulsion technology is developed which eventually allows humanity to enter into interstellar travel. Thusly, did mankind's colonization begin in other star systems. By the end of the 15th Millennium humanity begins to use sub-light spacecraft, at first only nearby star systems can be reached and the human colonies established on them must survive as independent states since they are separated from Earth by up to ten generations of travel time.</p><p>Almost nothing of this period's events is known to current Imperial historians, though it is known that the Emperor was alive and on Earth throughout this period, disguising his true abilities and immortal nature as he moved from identity to identity, always trying to improve and better humanity as a whole, physically, technologically, intellectually and spiritually.</p><h3>14,000 AD to 23,000 AD</h3><p>The Dark Age of Technology.</p><h3>23,000 AD to 28,000 AD</h3><p>The Age of Strife.</p><h3>30,000 AD</h3><p>The Horus Heresy.</p><h2>Video games</h2><h3>Dawn of War</h3><p>The campaign was driven by an excellent story and characters. The 4 initial races were Space Marine, Ork, Eldar, and Chaos. The game also featured Online matchmaking via Gamespy.</p><h4>Expansion packs</h4><p><b>Winter Assault</b> - Featured a story driven campaign and excellent characters, the addition being the Imperial Guard.</p><p><b>Dark Crusade</b> - The design philosophy changed here, instead of a story driven campaign, they now switched to a meta-map conquering a planet with lore background for each milestone within campaign. It also allowed the campaign to be played with any of the 7 races. The additions were Tau and Necron.</p><p><b>Soulstorm</b> - Relic did not work on this game and handed it over to Iron Lore. This expanded the previous meta map into 4 worlds to be conquered. The additions were the Sisters of Battle and Dark Eldar. The multiplayer received a slight improvement in the form of online medals for certain achievements.</p><h3>Dawn of War II</h3><p>Released in 2009 by Relic, this time it was moved across to a new much improved engine. The old base building was removed in favour of small squad tactics. The meta map and story driven campaign were both merged together, the multiplayer was also overhauled this time to use Windows Live, it also featured GFWL achievements. The four races were Space Marine, Ork, Eldar, and Tyranid.</p><h4>Expansion packs</h4><p>The first expansion was Chaos Rising, it introduced the Chaos forces as the new race to fight against during the campaign. The expansion follows in the same style as DoW II, with branching paths and additional objectives being displayed on an open world map. Most of the old characters from the previous game reprise their roles, with some new additions such as the Librarian, Jonah Orion.</p><h2>Novels</h2><p>There are many Warhammer 40k books out there; The Horus Heresy series being the most popular.</p><h3>The Horus Heresy Series</h3><p>The Horus Heresy series is an ongoing set of novels that describe how the Emperor's most beloved son, Horus, was corrupted by the dark powers of Chaos, and his betrayal of the Emperor.</p><ul><li><em><strong>Horus Rising</strong></em> - Dan Abnett (April 2006)</li><li><strong><em>False Gods</em></strong> - Graham McNeill (June 2006)</li><li><strong><em>Galaxy</em> <em>in</em> <em>Flames</em></strong> - Ben Counter (Oct 2006)</li><li><strong><em>The</em> <em>Flight</em> <em>of</em> <em>the</em> <em>Eisenstein</em></strong> - James Swallow (March 2007)</li><li><em><strong>Fulgrim</strong> </em>- Graham McNeill (July 2007)</li><li><strong><em>Descent</em> <em>of Angels</em></strong> - Mitchel Scanlon (October 2007)</li><li><em><strong>Legion</strong> </em>- Dan Abnett (March 2008)</li><li><em><strong>The Dark King &amp; The Lightning Tower</strong> </em>(Audio Book) - Graham McNeill &amp; Dan Abnett (June 2008)</li><li><em><strong>Battle for the Abyss</strong> </em>- Ben Counter (August 2008)</li><li><em><strong>Mechanicum</strong> </em>- Graham McNeill (December 2008)</li><li><strong><em>Tales of Heresy</em></strong> - Kyme &amp; Priestley (April 2009)</li><li><em><strong>Fallen Angels</strong> </em>- Mike Lee (July 2009)</li><li><em><strong>Raven\u2019s Flight</strong></em> (Audio Book) - Gav Thorpe (Feb 2010)</li><li><em><strong>A Thousand Sons</strong></em> - Graham McNeill (March 2010)</li><li><em><strong>Nemesis</strong> </em>- James Swallow (August 2010)</li><li><em><strong>The First Heretic</strong> </em>- Aaron Dembski-Bowden (October 2010)</li><li><em><strong>Prospero Burns</strong></em> - Dan Abnett (January 2011)</li><li><em><strong>Age of Darkness</strong></em> - Christian Dunn (May 2011)</li><li><em><strong>The Outcast Dead</strong> </em>- Graham McNeill (November 2011)</li><li><em><strong>Deliverance Lost</strong> </em>- Gav Thorpe (January 2012)</li><li><em><strong>Know No Fear</strong></em> - Dan Abnett (February 2012)</li><li><em><strong>The Primarchs</strong></em> - Christian Dunn (May 2012)</li><li><em><strong>Fear to Tread</strong></em> - James Swallow (August 2012)</li><li><em><strong>Shadows of Treachery</strong></em> - Christian Dunn and Nick Kyme (September 2012)</li><li><em><strong>Angel Exterminatus</strong> </em>- Graham McNeill (November 2012)</li><li><em><strong>Betrayer</strong> </em>- Aaron Dembski-Bowden (December 2012)</li></ul>", "guid": "3025-227", "name": "Warhammer 40,000"}, {"description": "<h2><b>History &amp; Setting</b></h2><p>Originally created in 1983, the Warhammer franchise is best known for their tabletop fantasy battle game. Since the initial release of the core game rules, there has been seven updates with the most recent update being released on July 10, 2010. The Warhammer tabletop and follow up video games take place in a world that is best described as a mix of medieval <a data-ref-id=\"3035-281\" href=\"/germany/3035-281/\">Germany</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3040-47777\" href=\"/j-r-r-tolkien/3040-47777/\">J.R. R. Tolkien\u2019s</a> <a data-ref-id=\"3035-193\" href=\"/middle-earth/3035-193/\">Middle Earth</a>. The world is characterized by being darker and grittier than most standard fantasy settings. This is a world at war and the populace and countryside is bleak. There are various races that live and battle in this setting and many of them are standard to most high fantasy settings. The races are:</p><p>\u00b7 <b><a data-ref-id=\"3015-2910\" href=\"/beastmen/3015-2910/\">Beastmen</a></b></p><p>\u00b7 <b>Bretonnia</b></p><p>\u00b7 <b><a data-ref-id=\"3015-2513\" href=\"/daemons/3015-2513/\">Daemons of Chaos</a></b></p><p>\u00b7 <b><a data-ref-id=\"3015-940\" href=\"/dwarves/3015-940/\">Dwarfs</a></b></p><p>\u00b7 <b><a data-ref-id=\"3015-3914\" href=\"/high-elves/3015-3914/\">High Elves</a></b></p><p>\u00b7 <b><a data-ref-id=\"3015-3231\" href=\"/reptilian-humanoid/3015-3231/\">Lizardmen</a></b></p><p>\u00b7 <b>Ogre Kingdoms</b></p><p>\u00b7 <b><a data-ref-id=\"3015-492\" href=\"/orc/3015-492/\">Orcs</a> &amp; <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1593\" href=\"/goblins/3015-1593/\">Goblins</a> (Greenskins)</b></p><p>\u00b7 <b><a data-ref-id=\"3015-2045\" href=\"/skaven/3015-2045/\">Skaven</a></b></p><p>\u00b7 <b>The Empire</b></p><p>\u00b7 <b><a data-ref-id=\"3015-3787\" href=\"/tomb-kings/3015-3787/\">Tomb Kings</a></b></p><p>\u00b7 <b>Vampire Counts</b></p><p>\u00b7 <b><a data-ref-id=\"3015-650\" href=\"/chaos/3015-650/\">Warriors of Chaos</a></b></p><p>\u00b7 <b><a data-ref-id=\"3015-3915\" href=\"/wood-elves/3015-3915/\">Wood Elves</a></b></p><h2><b>Tabletop Gameplay</b></h2><p>The tabletop game is played using army miniatures, multisided dice rolls, and an established setting, The creation and painting of these army miniatures is a core component of the game and can be very expensive and time consuming. To many players, the story and background of the miniature characters and armies are just as important as the games themselves. The tabletop games can involve multiple armies as the setting would allow. There is a tournament circuit for hardcore players as well as gaming sessions in local comic book stores for the more casual crowd. Due to the strategic nature of the tabletop game, the ideal genre of video game for Warhammer is strategy, either <a data-ref-id=\"3015-192\" href=\"/turn-based/3015-192/\">turn based</a> or <a href=\"/games/?sort=release_date&amp;filter_type=genre&amp;filter_value=12/\">real-time</a>.

It is considered the first <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/polygonal-3d/3015-1430/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1430\">3D polygon</a>-based fighting game, and the first fighting game to allow movement on a 3D plane that would later provide the inspiration for other 3D fighting series like <a href=\"/tekken/3025-333/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-333\">Tekken</a> and <a href=\"/dead-or-alive/3025-135/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-135\">Dead or Alive</a>.</p><p>The first game only had 8 fighters plus the unplayable boss character Dural and an Arabic character named Siba (though he was cut from the final roster) who was mistakenly named Akira. Being 1993, Sega had no home console powerful enough to run the game. Instead the team worked on a port for Sega's next generation system the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/saturn/3045-42/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-42\">Saturn</a>. In the meantime Sega developed a version for the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/sega-32x/3045-31/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-31\">Sega 32X</a>, which became one of the benchmark games for the ill-fated platform.</p><p>Virtua Fighters appeared as one of the launch titles during May of 1995. The game was however rushed and players noticed that the game lacked polish. Sega made right by fans by releasing Virtua Fighters Remix, a version of the game free of the glitches and bugs in the original, and offered it free of charge to everyone who bought the first game.</p><p><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/virtua-fighter-2/3030-41/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-41\">Virtua Fighter 2 </a>was released in the arcade on Sega's new \"Model 2\" arcade hardware in 1994. Shun Di and Lion were added to the roster.Sega released a home version for the Saturn in December 1995 and eventually a scaled down 2D version of the game for the Sega Genesis in 1996.</p><p>In 1996, <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/virtua-fighter-3/3030-19766/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19766\">Virtua Fighter 3 </a>was released for Sega's next \"Model 3\" hardware. It added Taka-Arashi and Aoi to the list of playable characters. 3tb came one year later. VF3 also added a \"Dodge\" command and moving stages to increase the amount of strategy required. Taka-Arashi was later removed from future versions of the game, as the developers claimed that they had trouble balancing his large hitbox with those of the other characters. Also, the \"Dodge\" button and moving stages from VF3 were scrapped and never returned in future installments.</p><p><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/virtua-fighter-4/3030-4313/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4313\">Virtua Fighter 4</a> introduced Lei-Fei and Vanessa to the game, adding graphical changes and released on the brand new \"NAOMI 2\" hardware in 2001. The game also introduced the option of customizing character clothing and hairstyles from a list of different options. Under 2 years later, <a href=\"/virtua-fighter-4-evolution/3030-4891/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4891\">VF4: Evolution</a> was released, adding another pair of fighters: Brad Burns and Goh Hinogami, along with a revamped training mode. VF4: Evo was also released on the PS3 at a discounted price compared to most new games.</p><p><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/virtua-fighter-5/3030-707/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-707\">Virtua Fighter 5</a> was released in 2006 on Sega's new \"Lindbergh\" arcade board, adding yet another pair of new characters: Eileen and El Blaze. Ports were released for the Playstation 3 (Ver. B) and XBOX 360 (Ver. C). Though the developers originally were against adding any online mode to the game, they relented with the later release of the 360 version, providing support for online play through XBOX Live though the rooms would only fit the two people fighting and no one else. The 360 port was officially called \"Virtua Fighter 5: Online\" in the US and \"Virtua Fighter 5: Live Arena\" in Japan.</p><p><a href=\"/virtua-fighter-5-r/3030-20749/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20749\">Virtua Fighter 5 R</a> was released into Japanese arcades in 2008. Aside from adding more costume customization options, the game also added two characters to the playable roster: Jean Kujo and the return of Taka-Arashi. The game was never officially released outside of Japan. However, another revision called <a href=\"/virtua-fighter-5-final-showdown/3030-30064/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-30064\">Virtua Fighter 5: Final Showdown</a> was released in 2010 in Japanese arcades, with a digital-only release to Western markets in June 2012 on XBOX 360 and PS3 through the consoles' respective online stores.</p><p>The franchise then went dark with no further updates until June 1, 2021, where SEGA released <a href=\"/virtua-fighter-5-ultimate-showdown/3030-84306/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-84306\">Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown</a> as a digital-only PS4 release.

A couple of characters from this game later appeared in Fighters Megamix.</p><p>There had long been plans for an RPG spinoff of the series. Initially one was proposed for the Sega Saturn but was delayed, eventually being recast and rebranded. The resulting game was released in 1999 as <i><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/shenmue/3030-7812/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7812\">Shenmue</a> </i>and has no obvious ties to the Virtua Fighter series other than collectible figurines that can be found throughout.

There are 4 games that are definitive successors to the main game: Ghosts 'n Goblins, Ghouls 'n Ghosts, Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts, and Ultimate Ghosts 'n Goblins. The first two being released for arcades first, (unique hardware and <a href=\"/cps/3015-2020/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2020\">CPS-1</a>, respectively) but are more famous for the <a href=\"/nintendo-entertainment-system/3045-21/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-21\">NES</a> port of the former and the <a href=\"/genesis/3045-6/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-6\">Genesis</a> port of the latter; then the third was made uniquely for the <a href=\"/snes/3055-2795/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2795\">SNES</a> and the forth for the <a href=\"/playstation-portable/3045-18/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-18\">PSP</a>.</p><p>There are also games arguably just as much part of the series, but are relegated to secondary status for their obscurity: <a href=\"/makaimura-for-wonderswan/3030-42058/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-42058\">Makaimura for Wonderswan</a>, Ghosts 'n Goblins: Gold Knights <a href=\"/ghosts-n-goblins-gold-knights/3030-25019/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-25019\">I</a> &amp; <a href=\"/ghosts-n-goblins-gold-knights-ii/3030-42060/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-42060\">II</a>, and <a href=\"/makaimura-online/3030-42890/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-42890\">Makaimura Online</a>. <a href=\"/arthur-to-astaroth-no-nazo-makimura-incredible-too/3030-42061/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-42061\">Arthur to Astaroth no Nazomakaimura: Incredible Toons</a> is little more than a different puzzle game rebranded to fit the series, but carries the Makaimura brand nonetheless.</p><h4>Gameplay</h4><p>The first game is a cartoonish, gothic themed side-scrolling platformer where the player is able to wield a variety of medieval weaponry near-strictly as projectiles. There can be a certain amount of each projectile on screen at any given time depending on which one is equipped. In this way the gameplay very much resembles the Mega Man series also released by Capcom, which eclipses it in popularity but in which it predates by 2 years. Weapons are equipped by touching them, and since some situations require you to so that you can avoid death, and since it overwrites the previously held weapon, this can cause great frustration, as some weapon types hold clear advantages over others.</p><p>The second game added the ability to throw weapons up or down as well as right and left, significantly altering gameplay. The third game added a double jump while removing vertical attacks. The fourth kept both vertical attacks and double jumps, the latter as one of few abilities gained throughout the game - which undoubtedly has the most RPG elements in the franchise.</p><p>The most enemy types will continuously spawn, forcing the player to be constantly active to stay alive while the game is not paused. There are few consistent enemy types throughout the series, most notably the Red Arremer - one of which would star in his own series within the same world.</p><p>The game is notorious for forcing the player to play through the entire game again in order to face the last boss, get the true ending, and technically beat the game.</p><h4>Story</h4><p>As was prevalent at the time, the game features a plot where Arthur has to rescue the princess (Princess Prin-Prin/Guinevere) from her evil kidnappers. These kidnappers are the army of the Demon Realm with an ever-changing chain of command. Satan is a fuzzy gargoyle often shown as the one kidnapping her, but is clearly under the command of another demon. Whoever is the last boss in each game is evidently also the ruler of the Demon Realm at the time, being Astaroth in the first, Lucifer (Loki in the Genesis version) in the second, the Demon Emperor Samael/Sardius in the third, and Hades in the fourth. Astaroth appears in all of the games, but after his original defeat he is always a subordinate of the ruler who has taken his place.</p><p>While these games exemplify who ranks above who in the Demon Realm by the order which they are fought, the Gargoyle's Quest series serves to exemplify their politics and contrasting personalities with far greater complexity, serving to explain the reasoning behind changes in leadership.</p><p>In Ultimate Ghosts 'n Goblins, it is finally revealed why members of the Demon Realm continue to kidnap Princess Prin-Prin: she is the last human in the game's world with royal blood in her veins, and she is sought because if her blood is mixed with that of a demon's through precarious means, it would give the Demon Realm control over the Human Realm.</p><h2>Gargoyle's Quest</h2><p>This series consists of Gargoyle's Quest, Gargoyle's Quest II, and Demon's Crest. While it would be easy to mistake these games as another series at a glance in the West, each of them are given the subtitle Makaimura Gaiden in Japan, solidifying them as part of the same series. The protagonist is <a href=\"/firebrand/3005-2548/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2548\">Firebrand</a>, a unique Red Arremer, in the same Ghoul Realm that the other Makaimura games take place in.</p><h4>Gameplay</h4><p>The core of the gameplay takes place in sidescrolling stages not unlike Ghosts 'n Goblins, though with very different mechanics due to the different main character. However, unique to this series is an overworld and NPCs to engage with, giving it quite a bit of non-linearity. This mix could be compared to the gameplay style of <a href=\"/zelda-ii-the-adventure-of-link/3030-16241/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16241\">Zelda II</a>. The first two games also feature <a href=\"/final-fantasy/3030-8403/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8403\">Final Fantasy</a>-like overhead towns to visit with many NPCs to interact with, random encounters in the overworld, and abilties which can be leveled up. The third has Firebrand soaring over the overworld rather than walking through it, ditching random encounters and large NPC filled towns while retaining the option to complete levels in whichever order the player chooses, abilities that are gained through the pursuant progression, and dialogue with NPCs (though much more sparse).</p><h4>Story</h4><p>The chronological order of the games is Gargoyle's Quest II, Gargoyle's Quest and Demon's Crest last.</p><p>Interestingly, the ending of Gargoyle's Quest has Firebrand \"rewarded\" with the choice to oversee humanity in the Human Realm, as they have just been created. He is offered the right to conquer this realm if he wants, which he presumably turns down, though this is never explored further. This likely places these games thousands of years prior to the core Ghosts 'n Goblins series.</p><p>Demon's Crest however occupies an unknown chronology. The main antagonist, Phalanx, mentions that he lost in battle against Firebrand a thousand years prior. Thus he is likely to have existed at the time of Ghosts 'n Goblins, even though he actually never appears in the games as one of the Red Arremers encountered.</p><h2><a href=\"/maximo/3025-516/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-516\">Maximo</a></h2><p>The Maximo series has been stated canonically (and not refuted) to take place within the Ghosts 'n Goblins series. While not directly tied to any of the other games, obvious similarites include a reminiscent cartoonish art style, a gothic world and enemies, wearing nothing but heart-pattern boxers when you are hit, to even using the main Ghosts 'n Goblins theme in certain areas. They are the only fully 3D games to take place within the universe.</p><h4>Story</h4><p>Maximo is a king betrayed by his aide, Achille, who has kidnapped his love Queen Sophia and forced her to marry him, and has also harvested souls of the underworld to create his own army of the undead. Upon trying to rescue Sophia, Maximo is killed, but is brought back by Death whose job is threatened by Achille's actions causing the loss of the dead. The sequel deals with Maximo searching for Sophia, and is interrupted by the Zin - an ancient army of robot-like creatures powered by lost souls.</p><p>It is notable that, while the Ghosts 'n Goblins characters are named after ones of Arthurian legend, the characters of Maximo are loosely based on figures in Greek/Roman history. If based on real world chronology at all, this would logically place the Maximo series in a time period prior to the main Ghosts 'n Goblins series.</p><p>Also, bosses in the original games are most often named after either biblical demons or demon-like creatures from world mythology, while the bosses in Maximo are simple ghoulish names such as \"Ghastly Gus\" and \"Lord Glutterscum\". It is unknown how much these creatures (if at all) are related to the Ghoul Realm. Due to the lack of commonality, and the explanation behind the presence of all the enemies in the Maximo games, it would seem this story arc only documents the evil which occurs within the Human Realm of the same universe.</p>", "guid": "3025-243", "name": "Ghosts 'n Goblins"}, {"description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>The God of War series is a Sony-exclusive franchise of third-person action games that has appeared on the <a href=\"/playstation-2/3045-19/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-19\">PlayStation 2</a>, <a href=\"/playstation-portable/3045-18/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-18\">PlayStation Portable</a>, and <a href=\"/playstation-3/3045-35/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-35\">PlayStation 3</a> consoles. The game takes place during the mythological time of ancient Greece, inserting the protagonist <a href=\"/kratos/3005-645/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-645\">Kratos</a> into Greek myth. It tells the story of how Kratos, a Spartan Army Captain, pledges his allegiance to <a href=\"/ares/3005-1098/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1098\">Ares</a> after being defeated in battle. Ares grants him the god-like <a href=\"/blades-of-chaos/3055-93/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-93\">Blades of Chaos</a>, weapons that allow him to dominate the battlefield. Ares continues to use Kratos to wage war across Greece, and tricks him into killing his wife and daughter, thinking it will make him a better warrior. The plan backfires, and Kratos renounces his master, and vows revenge on the God of War. The games in the series continue to centralize on this theme of revenge, and the stories of how these circumstances came to be.</p><p>The first game in the series was created and directed by outspoken game developer <a href=\"/david-jaffe/3040-44184/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-44184\">David Jaffe</a>, and received critical acclaim and numerous awards when it was released in 2005. Sony quickly green-lit the development of a sequel, which was also a commercial success. The series has since become a flagship title for Sony, with a new game being released nearly every year, to mostly favorable reviews.</p><p> </p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The games in the series all have extremely similar gameplay. The games are hyper-violent move-based brawlers, allowing for combinations of button presses to execute different types of attacks. As players move through the game, they are able to unlock more complicated moves and better weapons in order to defeat tougher enemies. Certain areas of the game have some light puzzle elements &amp; platforming to them, such as pushing blocks or pulling levers. There are also collectibles to search for, which also grant bonuses to health and magic meters. The games also heavily feature Quick Time Events that usually trigger more cinematic gameplay experiences.</p><p> </p><h2>Games</h2><h4>In Order of Release:</h4><p> </p><h3>God of War (PS2)</h3><p>The original <a href=\"/god-of-war/3030-6959/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6959\">God of War</a> was released on March 22, 2005 for the PlayStation 2.

The Gracies believed that if the masses saw the smaller, babyfaced Royce defeating larger opponents it would advertise the efficacy of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.</p><p>Royce went on to win the entire tournament, easily beating the larger and stronger opponents by taking the fight to the ground and forcing them to submit by utilizing chokes and joint locks. Eventually as the sport of MMA grew, styles clashed. Those versed in striking arts began to learn wrestling in order to prevent being taken to the ground, the grapplers learned to strike and so on. Thus most of today's top competitors are well rounded in many fighting styles including Brazilian Jiu jitsu, wrestling, boxing, Muay-Thai, Judo, and others.</p><p>The UFC was eventually purchased by Zuffa.

Hasbro had great success utilizing this technology and some of the designs in a rebranded form as <i>G.I. Joe</i>: A Real American Hero, so they set about importing and rebranding more of Takara's innovative toy designs. In 1980, Takara had launched <i>Diaclones</i>, a line of toy robots that could be folded up or \"transformed\" into vehicles and piloted by <i>Inch-Man</i> toys, tiny magnetic spinoffs from the <i>Microman</i> series. In 1982, the 'Car-Robot' series of <i>Diaclones</i> was produced, featuring transforming robots who disguised themselves as unremarkable terrestrial vehicles. When, in 1984, Hasbro and Takara partnered up and merged parts of the <i>Microman</i> and <i>Diaclones</i> toy lines under a single new brand, it was this 'Car-Robot' series and its star product 'Battle Convoy', a semi truck-trailer that transformed into a command platform and distinctive <a data-ref-id=\"3005-151\" href=\"/optimus-prime/3005-151/\" slug=\"optimus-prime\">red-and-blue robot</a>, that formed the basis for the new <i>Transformers</i> franchise<i>.</i></p><p>Hasbro hired Jim Shooter, Dennis O'Neil and Bob Budiansky, a team of comic book writers who had mostly worked on <a data-ref-id=\"3025-173\" href=\"/marvel/3025-173/\" slug=\"marvel\">Marvel</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3025-138\" href=\"/dc-universe/3025-138/\" slug=\"dc-universe\">DC Comic</a>s properties, to invent a backstory and set of identities for the pre-existing <i>Diaclones</i> designs. Using elements of Takara's earlier concept of alien robots infiltrating earth in a disguised form, the basic premise was that two warring factions of robots, the righteous Autobots and villanous Decepticons, had crash-landed on pre-historic Earth and been reactivated in the present day, learning to disguise themselves as Earth vehicles in order to continue their war without attracting the attention of the native populace.</p><p>In the same year, Hasbro developed a number of media tie-ins to promote their new IP - a cartoon series produced by Sunbow Productions (later taken over by Hasbro), and a comic book series published by Marvel. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLS2N9mHWaw\" rel=\"nofollow \">The show's theme tune</a>, composed by Anne Bryant and Ford Kinder, contained the iconic lines \"Robots In Disguise\" and \"More Than Meets The Eye\", two catchphrases which came to define the entire franchise in all its subsequent forms.</p><h2><b>Generation 1: 1984-1993</b></h2><p><b>Cartoon Series:</b></p><p>The <i>Transformers</i> franchise was insanely popular throughout the rest of the 80s and into the early 90s. The cartoon series in particular was a huge hit, driving massive sales of the toy lines from the onset of its first two seasons and spawning a movie spin-off in 1986, with a third season and final three-part miniseries, entitled <i>The Rebirth</i>, concluding the Generation 1 (G1) cartoon series in 1987.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/24523/1296343-transformers.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1296343\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.74571428571429\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.6%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/24523/1296343-transformers.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1296343\"><img alt=\"The original show's logo\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/2/24523/1296343-transformers.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/2/24523/1296343-transformers.jpg 350w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-width=\"350\"></a><figcaption>The original show's logo</figcaption></figure><p>Initially, the cartoon's only purpose was to provide a basic over-arching storyline and periodically introduce new characters to coincide with the release of their action figure counterparts. This was done on a tight schedule and animated by a host of different studios spread across Japan and Asia, which led to disconnected storylines with little continuity between shows in the first two seasons, with whole plots revolving around the introduction of groups of new characters simply to generate buzz around the release of a new toy. In many cases, characters from the show bore only a vague resemblance to their respective figures due to the necessities of easy animation and simple, recognizable design. Despite this disjointed and inconsistent quality, the first two seasons were an enormous success and the quality of the voice acting and characterization led to a broad roster of extremely memorable characters like <a data-ref-id=\"3005-151\" href=\"/optimus-prime/3005-151/\" slug=\"optimus-prime\">Optimus Prime</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2175\" href=\"/megatron/3005-2175/\" slug=\"megatron\">Megatron</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1883\" href=\"/bumblebee/3005-1883/\" slug=\"bumblebee\">Bumblebee</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1786\" href=\"/starscream/3005-1786/\" slug=\"starscream\">Starscream</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-11902\" href=\"/soundwave/3005-11902/\" slug=\"soundwave\">Soundwave</a>.</p><p>The basic plot in the first two seasons dealt with some back story about the conflict between the Autobots, led by Optimus Prime (voiced by <a data-ref-id=\"3040-81906\" href=\"/peter-cullen/3040-81906/\" slug=\"peter-cullen\">Peter Cullen</a>), and the Decepticons under the command of Megatron (voiced by <a data-ref-id=\"3040-10099\" href=\"/frank-welker/3040-10099/\" slug=\"frank-welker\">Frank Welker</a>). Hailing from the planet <a data-ref-id=\"3035-939\" href=\"/cybertron/3035-939/\" slug=\"cybertron\">Cybertron</a> , a single race of sentient machines split off into the two warring factions as the hard-working labourers came to be oppressed by the increasingly domineering military robots. This escalated into an all-out war over the remaining supplies of Energon, the planet's primary resource. Eventually Cybertron becomes a dead world, bereft of Energon, and each side rounds up its finest warriors to depart on their flagships, the Autobots' <i>Ark</i> and the Decepticons' <i>Nemesis</i>, to find other planets with rich energy supplies for the Transformers to bring back and bring new life to their home. The two ships enter into a fierce battle, and both crash land on Earth, their crews deactivated until 4 million years later in 1984, when a nearby volcanic eruption prompts the <i>Ark</i> 's computer, Teletraan I, to scan the planet for signs of life and reactivate the Autobots. Not being able to recognize bio-organic life forms, the computer takes scans of terrestrial machinery and technology, enabling the Transformers to reconfigure themselves into Earth vehicle forms in order to blend in with the locals.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11332/403625-optimus_prime__powermaster_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-403625\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.2325581395349\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:123.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11332/403625-optimus_prime__powermaster_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-403625\"><img alt=\"Optimus Prime\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/11332/403625-optimus_prime__powermaster_.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/11332/403625-optimus_prime__powermaster_.jpg 817w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/11332/403625-optimus_prime__powermaster_.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/11332/403625-optimus_prime__powermaster_.jpg 519w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 519px) 100vw, 519px\" data-width=\"519\"></a><figcaption>Optimus Prime</figcaption></figure><p>Each episode of the show tended to revolve around the Decepticons' latest evil plan to commandeer Earth's resources and convert it to Energon, while the more cooperative Autobots team up with beleaguered Earthlings to thwart Megatron's increasingly outlandish plans.</p><p><i>Transformers: The Movie</i>, which went on general release in the US on August 8th, 1986, moves the timeline forward 20 years to 2005. It featured a host of big-name actors including <a data-ref-id=\"3040-15210\" href=\"/leonard-nimoy/3040-15210/\" slug=\"leonard-nimoy\">Leonard Nimoy</a>, Orson Welles, Scatman Crothers and <a data-ref-id=\"3040-4727\" href=\"/eric-idle/3040-4727/\" slug=\"eric-idle\">Eric Idle</a>. Introducing a huge range of entirely new characters, it went as far as killing off whole groups of much-beloved regular cast members in favor of a new main cast (with the obligatory action figure tie-ins), making it quite controversial among fans at the time. In the movie, Optimus Prime is killed by Megatron early on and unwittingly passes the Matrix of Leadership, the source of his powers, on to a young Autobot named Hot Rod, who goes on to reunite the routed Autobots and destroy <a data-ref-id=\"3005-11901\" href=\"/unicron/3005-11901/\" slug=\"unicron\">Unicron</a> (a world-eating transformer who is like a cross between <a data-ref-id=\"3005-4845\" href=\"/galactus/3005-4845/\" slug=\"galactus\">Galactus</a> and the <a data-ref-id=\"3035-205\" href=\"/death-star/3035-205/\" slug=\"death-star\">Death Star</a>) and continue to lead the war against Megatron, who was betrayed by Starscream and resurrected by Unicron as the more-powerful Galvatron.</p><p>While fondly remembered (particularly for its famous theme song, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYRxf13tIg\" rel=\"nofollow \">\"The Touch\" by Stan Bush</a>), the changes to the main cast resulted in an outcry from the fans, prompting Hasbro to bring Optimus Prime back to life as leader of the Autobots at the end of the third and final cartoon series, which aired in 1987.</p><p><b>Comic series:</b></p><p>The Marvel Comics series began in conjunction with the initial release of the cartoon and ran in a standard monthly format in the US for 80 issues ending in the spring of 1991. It started off as part of the main Marvel Universe in 1984, and the first few issues featured crossover stories with <a data-ref-id=\"3005-69\" href=\"/spider-man/3005-69/\" slug=\"spider-man\">Spider-Man</a> and other well-known Marvel characters. From the very beginning, the plot of the comic series diverged from that of the cartoon and toy lines in various ways, mostly pertaining to the motivations and relationships between characters.</p><p>In the UK, however, the standard format for comic book releases at the time was based on a fortnightly or even weekly schedule, so when the US Marvel comics started to be reprinted there, a huge number of brand new stories were produced in order to fill in, expand upon and pad out the developments in the US monthly releases. This led to a great deal more confusion and inconsistency between the two comics timelines, where all manner of improbable and often contradictory explanations were given (or sometimes no explanation at all) for the changes in appearance or even outright death of some characters in one or the other continuity, The UK comics switched from a fortnightly to a weekly format, and then back to fortnightly, running for a total of 332 issues until 1992.</p><p><b>Video Games:</b></p><p>Not many video games were released based on the G1 Transformers series.

The earlier Transformers series of cartoons, comics and toys were, as a result, retroactively labeled 'Generation 1' by the fans.</p><p>Because the UK and Japan had still maintained a steady release of Transformers material up to then, the series did not require a reboot or comeback in those territories, so the Transformers storylines in all three regions were completely different throughout the G2 period. As a result, the G2 series, while featuring most of the same cast as G1 and intended as a continuation of the main Transformers timeline for the US, is not widely known about and not necessarily considered part of the main series canon.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7504/815221-196741_10857_front.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-815221\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7504/815221-196741_10857_front.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-815221\"><img alt=\"There were a few Beast Wars licensed games, including this one on PSOne\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-width=\"640\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7504/815221-196741_10857_front.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7504/815221-196741_10857_front.jpg 595w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/7504/815221-196741_10857_front.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"There were a few Beast Wars licensed games, including this one on PSOne\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7504/815221-196741_10857_front.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7504/815221-196741_10857_front.jpg 595w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/7504/815221-196741_10857_front.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-width=\"640\"></noscript></a><figcaption>There were a few Beast Wars licensed games, including this one on PSOne</figcaption></figure><p>There are no video games based on this period, and although a G2 television series was nominally produced, it was actually just a rerun of G1 episodes with basic CG intros shoehorned in.</p><h2>Other Series (1996-2007)</h2><p>By 1995, general public interest in the flagging Transformers brand was nonexistent, and with Takara focusing on new toy IPs in Japan, Hasbro canceled all productions and moved its toy lines over to the newly-acquired Kenner company, who came up with the dinosaur-themed <i>Beast Wars</i> spinoff series which would take over the Transformers name from 1996-2001.</p><p>The Transformers, in their original and best known and loved form, were all but forgotten about in the West and consigned to the nostalgic reminiscences of the 80s generation (right up until <a data-ref-id=\"3040-61468\" href=\"/michael-bay/3040-61468/\" slug=\"michael-bay\">Michael Bay</a>'s execrable live-action movie reboot in 2007) despite various Japanese spinoffs like \"Headmasters\" and \"Robots In Disguise\" and some more comic book series by Marvel and Dreamwave.

The player controls one of seven daimyos (feudal lords) of Sengoku-period Japan, each of which have a unique strategic bonus and starting troops. Shogun introduced many gameplay elements which remain in the franchise to the present, such as specialized agents, an experience system (called Honor) by which units grow more powerful through combat, and hugely-important terrain bonuses and penalties on the battlefield. Graphics for both the turn-based and real-time sections of the game were sprite-based, resulting in somewhat awkward battle animations but allowing an impressive number of units and projectiles to be rendered on the screen at any one time.

This game contains 50 factions and focuses on period's conquest, exploration, and founding of colonies. As a tutorial, the game explored the French and Indian war and the American Revolution, through the eyes of General George Washington. The Campaign Map now had economic and military improvements separate from the city, allowing players to harass enemy lands. In order to reflect the luxury trade of the era, trade ports were added into the game and cash crop farms were buildable in the more tropical areas. A technology tech tree was introduced that reflects the starts of Industrialism and the evolution of professional standing armies. Empire was also the first Total War game that had playable Naval Battles and deployable defenses before battles. The game also reintroduced the concept of allowing units to mount/dismount from horses.</p><p><b>Napoleon: Total War</b></p><p>Using the new engine made for Empire, the originally planned expansion to Empire: Total War, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-27879\" href=\"/napoleon-total-war/3030-27879/\" slug=\"napoleon-total-war\">Napoleon : Total War</a>, was released as a full game. The game revamped the combat factors present in Empire: Total War, and made land engagements more focused on artillery and morale. The game follows the career of Napoleon Bonaparte in mini campaigns that focused on his invasion of Northern Italy, command in Egypt, and finally a grand campaign during his years as Emperor. Players could also attempt to conquer Europe as Napoleon's rivals in the Grand Coalition campaign. The Historical Battles consist of some of Napoleon's most famous battles including Austerlitz, Friedland, Borodino, and Waterloo. Along with minor unit pack DLCs, Creative Assembly released a Peninsular Campaign DLC that focused on the Peninsular War of Wellington against the French in 1809. The Campaign Map improved upon that of Empire and introduced the concept of supply lines and <a data-ref-id=\"3015-5933\" href=\"/attrition/3015-5933/\" slug=\"attrition\">attrition</a>.

The game focused on Japan from the early 16th century to the early 17th century, which is characterized by growing European influence and the introduction of gunpowder to Japan. The leveling of Generals has been revamped and their traits are mostly customizable for the player. For the game, the multiplayer was completely redone, as players now had army customization, and Daiymos that would level up and gain talents that complimented the playing style of the user. The game also featured a Co-Op campaign that allowed two players to play the grand campaign together, and even share units during battles. The game's usual in game encyclopedia was now transitioned to being online.</p><p>Creative Assembly released two major additions to Total War: Shogun 2 in the form of the Rise of the Samurai and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-37717\" href=\"/total-war-shogun-2-fall-of-the-samurai/3030-37717/\" slug=\"total-war-shogun-2-fall-of-the-samurai\">Fall of the Samurai</a> campaigns. The Rise of Samurai was focused on the introduction of the aforementioned elite warrior class in the Genpei War, and the development of Japan's first major Shogunate. Fall of The Samurai is the closest to Modern Times the Total War series has ever gone with its focus on Japan's transition to an Empire and Industrialization. Japan is split between factions supporting the Shogunate or the Imperial Throne. Railroads link territory together, Steamships rule the seas, and Foreign armies walk the land. Fall of the Samurai also introduced the ability to manually aim, in a semi-first person mode, artillery at enemy forces, and doubled the number of units in an army from 20 to 40.</p><h3>Total War: Rome 2</h3><p>A planned sequel to the smash hit, Rome: Total War, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-38867\" href=\"/total-war-rome-ii/3030-38867/\" slug=\"total-war-rome-ii\">Total War: Rome 2</a> will allow players to control 8 different factions in the ancient world. The game will allow players to customize their path to victory by shaping their civilization through policy or by supporting families that specialize in unique areas.

Soldiers on the field will also have, for the first time, facial animations.</p>", "guid": "3025-265", "name": "Total War"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-266", "name": "Top Gear"}, {"description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Following British archeologist <a href=\"/lara-croft/3005-195/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-195\">Lara Croft</a>, the Tomb Raider series of games, comics, movies, theme park rides and novels are a pop-culture phenomenon the world over.</p><h2>Beginnings</h2><p>The development of <a href=\"/tomb-raider/3030-3023/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3023\">Tomb Raider</a> began in 1993, and took 3 years to complete. On November 15, 1996, Tomb Raider was finally made available for public consumption. The developers were <a href=\"/core-design-ltd/3010-318/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-318\">Core Design</a>, who spent 18 months working on the game. One of the reasons for this extensive development period is that the Core Design team consisted of only 6 people. It was <a href=\"/toby-gard/3040-22187/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-22187\">Toby Gard</a> who, out of the team of 6, undertook the task of developing Lara.</p><p>Originally, the lead character was set to be male, essentially no more than an Indiana Jones clone. It wasn't until Toby noticed many of his co-workers playing as female fighters from the game <a href=\"/virtua-fighter/3025-231/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-231\">Virtua Fighter</a> that he decided to alter the hero's sex and turn her into a heroine. At around this time, the entire team decided that puzzles and stealth would be a more appropriate approach to developing the game than the all too common action archetype.</p><p>Lara was born under the name Laura Cruz and was intended to be a cold blooded militaristic South African anti-hero. However, over time, Laura became a warmer character and Core Design decided to make Laura a British character, in order to make her feel more familiar to the intended American audiences. The name Lara Croft was supposedly taken by picking a name out from a phone book that was closest to Laura Cruz, whilst retaining a sense of Western impact.</p><p>Upon Tomb Raiders release, it was an immediate critical and financial success, securing a place in video-game history and ensuring a lengthy franchise for Lara Croft and her adventures, which would far surpass Core Designs original goals.</p><h2>Lara's Evolution</h2><p>Development on <a href=\"/tomb-raider-ii/3030-337/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-337\">Tomb Raider II</a> took a great deal less time than it's predecessor. Approximately one year later, in November of 1997, Tomb Raider II was released. The game became an instant success, immediately overtaking the original Tomb Raider in terms of sales and achieved equal, if not greater critical acclaim. However, in hindsight many fans feel that this was in fact the pinnacle of Lara's success. This is evident in her branching into other mediums, appearing prominently in SEAT and Lucozade commercials and practically becoming an unofficial mascot for the commercial pop-rock band, U2.</p><p>Another year passed and <a href=\"/tomb-raider-iii-adventures-of-lara-croft/3030-19596/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19596\">Tomb Raider III</a> entered the scene in November of 1998. It was widely cited as the best game of the original trilogy, with many of the mechanics having been refined, although many critics showed disappointment at the fact that not much had really changed at all since the original game.</p><p>On November 22, 1999, <a href=\"/tomb-raider-the-last-revelation/3030-10570/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10570\">Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation</a> surfaced. Critical reactions were mixed with some noting that the mechanics of the series had gone untouched and others citing the game as the best sequel in the series. If nothing else, most agreed that the story was far more dynamic than any other Tomb Raider game to date. However, by now many critics were feeling that Tomb Raider was a tired concept, at least in the sense that Core Design were barely altering gameplay. Despite Core Design's original intent for The Last Revelation to be the end to the franchise, business realities demanded more sequels be made.</p><p>Core Design, now shackled by their success, pushed ahead with another Tomb Raider project, <a href=\"/tomb-raider-chronicles/3030-10135/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10135\">Tomb Raider Chronicles</a>, which was released on November 19, 2000. Although the graphics were widely touted as being some of the best of the era, the game's reliance on flashback levels that invited direct and unflattering comparisons with its predecessor games was as clear as sign as any that the Tomb Raider franchise was directionless and stagnating badly. With sales sharply plunging, the franchise was in dire need of rejuvenation, and the impending release of the <a href=\"/playstation-2/3045-19/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-19\">PlayStation 2</a> was just such an opportunity.</p><p>On June 20, 2003, three years and two substantial delays later, <a href=\"/lara-croft-tomb-raider-the-angel-of-darkness/3030-6742/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6742\">Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness</a> was finally released. Core Design struggled to modernize and vary up the Tomb Raider formula with new features and gameplay. Sadly, the game's attempts at new features like urban environments, stealth gameplay, and an alternate playable character all fell flat. On top of that, the game was wracked with bugs. Critics skewered the game. Despite a modest uptick in sales, the game was a failure and the nail in Core Design's coffin. A planned sequel, called Tomb Raider: The Lost Dominion, was cancelled. <a href=\"/eidos-interactive/3010-658/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-658\">Eidos</a> closed down Core Design and turned the franchise that made and broke them over to <a href=\"/crystal-dynamics-inc/3010-959/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-959\">Crystal Dynamics</a>.</p><p>On April 7, 2006, <a href=\"/lara-croft-tomb-raider-legend/3030-8554/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8554\">Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Legend</a> was released for sixth and seventh generation consoles. Immediately topping the UK video game charts, the game held its number 1 spot for 3 weeks after. By June 30, 2006 the game had already sold approximately 2.9 million copies and was receiving strong reviews across the board. With Tomb Raider successfully resurrected, Crystal Dynamics had secured themselves a future with the franchise.</p><p>On June 1, 2007, Eidos and Crystal Dynamics rolled out their next Tomb Raider game, <a href=\"/lara-croft-tomb-raider-anniversary/3030-8201/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8201\">Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Anniversary</a>. Neither a remake of the first Tomb Raider nor a sequel to the last one, it was a reimagining of the first game with new tweaks that wove into the fictional universe established by Legend. Despite a largely positive reception, some expressed concern regarding the game's frustration level and the fact that the game's engine and mechanics were both identical to Legend. Despite Anniversary's sales being the lowest of any game in the franchise, they were still sufficient to make the game a success.</p><p>On November 18, 2008, the first game in the series to be created solely for seventh generation consoles was released. <a href=\"/tomb-raider-underworld/3030-20694/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20694\">Tomb Raider: Underworld</a> was a direct sequel to Legend. Some critics were underwhelmed, saying that the mechanics of the past two games were already growing old and that Crystal Dynamics were just throwing Lara new moves, instead of refining some of the older ones. Additional criticism targeted the game's poorly written story and dialogue. Nonetheless, the game still received mostly positive reviews with many critics noting the exemplary visual standard and the thrill of exploring the well rendered environments. Sales lagged at first, but eventually climbed to meet Eidos' expectations.</p><p>On March 4, 2010, Square Enix announced the newest entry in the franchise, <a href=\"/lara-croft-and-the-guardian-of-light/3030-30191/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-30191\">Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light</a>. Developed by Crystal Dynamics, it was the first Tomb Raider to not feature the words \"Tomb Raider\" in its title and the first series entry to only be distributed digitally over PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Marketplace. The game features an isometric viewpoint and co-operative play, both new features for the franchise. The game was well-received by most critics and praised for introducing a new style of gameplay to the series. Sales surpassed 1 million, a strong achievement for a download-only title.</p><p>Returning to the Tomb Raider name once more, Crystal Dynamics <a href=\"/same-name-reboot/3015-6524/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6524\">rebooted</a> the franchise with <a href=\"/tomb-raider/3030-27312/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-27312\">Tomb Raider</a>, an origin story game tracing a young Lara Croft as a survivor of a shipwreck. Rather than hunting for treasure, in this reboot Lara is just trying to survive a brutally hostile environment. The game was generally well-received by critics, with broad praise for its modern third-person shooter gameplay, and general comparisons frequently made to the popular <a href=\"/uncharted/3025-957/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-957\">Uncharted series</a>. As with Underworld, sales initially failed to meet expectations, but grew over time to surpass them.</p><p>On June 9, 2014, a sequel to the Tomb Raider reboot was announced in <a href=\"/rise-of-the-tomb-raider/3030-46549/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-46549\">Rise of the Tomb Raider</a>.

But how he has performed these tasks have varied. In            TimeSplitters 2, Cortez takes on the physical form of a different person, in the same vein of <i>Quantum Leap. </i>But in Future Perfect, he is his own self and even partners-up with people he took the role as in the previous game. <br/>\u00a0<br/>Throughout the course of the franchise, the story goes to different eras. These have included familiar settings like 1920's <a data-ref-id=\"3035-293\" href=\"/chicago/3035-293/\" slug=\"chicago\">      Chicago</a> and Victorian-era <a data-ref-id=\"3035-289\" href=\"/europe/3035-289/\" slug=\"europe\">     Europe</a>. However, the stories have also gone into the distant future setting the player on an alien planet or a robot factory. Some of these have been recurring, sometimes due to the overall significance of the story; such as a Cold War-era Spy setting and a <i>Terminator</i>-style war between man and killer robots. <br/><br/>During these missions, players sometimes have the option to play a mini-game. In TimeSplitters 2, players can find unlockable vector games in some missions. <br/><br/> <h3>Challenges<br/></h3>\u00a0Players may also take part in various challenges to compete for a high score; such as endurance rounds, target shooting, stealth, or destroying things, among others. These challenges usually come with a silly story to explain the scenario.<br/><br/>Playing these challenges, and getting a high-enough score, results in unlocking additional maps, characters, weapons, and cheats. <br/><br/> <h2>Arcade Mode<br/></h2> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1699/465441-snap_sony_dvd_recorder_volume_8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-465441\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1699/465441-snap_sony_dvd_recorder_volume_8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-465441\"><img alt=\"\u00a0Arcade Mode\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/1699/465441-snap_sony_dvd_recorder_volume_8.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/1699/465441-snap_sony_dvd_recorder_volume_8.jpg 768w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/1699/465441-snap_sony_dvd_recorder_volume_8.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/1699/465441-snap_sony_dvd_recorder_volume_8.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0Arcade Mode</figcaption></figure>         The core of the TimeSplitters franchise's experience has been its multiplayer.

The game did not receive a stateside release, but was released on several Japanese home computer systems, including Sharp, NEC, and Fujitsu's home computer platforms. The game uses a top-down camera angle similar to Namco's Xevious, and like Xevious, the character's ship only has two weapons \u2013 a forward firing short-range bomb for use against ground targets, and the ship's main gun.</p><p>The story introduces the conflict between the Galactic Federation (which is later revealed to not contain Earth), and the malevolent ORN empire. The player, controlling the FIRE LEO starfighter, is assigned to destroy ORN's asteroid fortress <i>Dyradeizer</i>.</p><h3>Thunder Force II</h3><p>After the destruction of the fortress Dyradeizer in the first game in the series, the ORN Empire, while it has experienced a setback, is not yet defeated. The Empire has begun work on a massive new battleship, called the <i>Plealos,</i> underneath the surface of the planet Nebula. With this new massive warship at their command, the ORN Empire can set out on a new offensive against the Galactic Federation that could potentially destroy it. In response to this new threat, the Galactic Federation sends their new starfighter, the FIRE LEO-02 <i>Exceliza</i> to Nebula to destroy their bases upon the service, and finally the <i>Plealos</i> itself.</p><p>While this game continues to use the top-down camera angle that was used in the first game, it also includes some levels in the side-scrolling camera angle that would be used in later games in the series. Additionally, this game also includes a weapon upgrade system, with enemies dropping power-ups for multiple different weapon types. Also, unlike other contemporary shooters, while the ship can only use one of its special weapons at a time, it can switch between them at will. The ship can also pick up weapon pods, called CLAWs, which rotate around the ship, increasing it's firepower, like the Options in the Gradius series (though they only fire normal shots), while the CLAWs can also block enemy shots like the Force from the R-Type series. Unlike the Force in the R-Type series the CLAWs cannot be launched like a weapon. Each CLAW power up adds one to the player's number of CLAWs, to a maximum of two.</p><p>This game was released first for Sharp's X68000 home computer systems in 1988, and then for the Sega Genesis the following year. The X68000 version included better voice samples (including some profanity), and improved graphics (including parallax scrolling and some transparency effects).</p><h3>Thunder Force III</h3><p>100 years after Thunder Force 1 &amp; 2, the war between the ORN Empire and the Galactic Federation carries on. The ORN empire has installed cloaking devices on five of their planets, protecting their main base, and the bio-computer that controls their entire empire, ChaOs. Further, they've installed a massive defense grid called <i>Cerebus</i>, which can block any battle fleet from penetrating the cloaking field. Once again the Federation's only hope lies on a single starfighter, the FIRE LEO-03 <i>Styx</i> \u2013 which is small enough to slip through the Empire's defenses, destroy the cloaking devices, infiltrate the enemy headquarters, destroy ChaOs, and end the war once and for all.</p><p>Among the gameplay changes from Thunder Force II and III, the CLAWs have now become more like the Options from Gradius \u2013 rather than firing normal shots, they now fire the same type of shot that the active special weapon is. Plus, when the player picks up the CLAW power up, the ship automatically gets the maximum number of CLAWs. Additionally, when the character is hit, the rather than losing all of the special weapon upgrades they have, they instead only lose the <i>active</i> special weapon.</p><p>This is the first game in the Thunder Force series not to get a home computer release in Japan. Instead the game was released for the Genesis. A variant was also released for the arcade and the SNES, titled Thunder Force AC in the arcades, and as Thunder Spirits on the SNES (due to Sega holding the trademark for the Thunder Force name). Both versions re-did some of the levels from the Genesis version, as well as the graphics, while the Arcade version added some re-makes of levels from Thunder Force II.</p><h3>Thunder Force IV</h3><p>While the ORN Empire has been beaten, it is not wiped out. The remnants of the Empire's forces and it's allies have united to form the organization \u201cVios\u201d, and have set out to seek revenge on the Galactic Federation. The Galactic Federation finds Vios' headquarters on the planet Aceria, amasses their forces and attacks, only to be repulsed. Once more, the Federation finds itself relying on its new model starfighter, the FIRE LEO-04 <i>Rynex</i>, to get through the planet's defenses and wipe out Fios, and save the Galactic Federation from destruction.</p><p>The fundamentals of the game have changed little from Thunder Force III, with a few refinements. The size of the stages extends above the top and bottom of the screen, allowing limited vertical scrolling in addition to the vertical scrolling. Also, the player is able to choose in what order to play the first four of the game's ten stages. At the game's halfway point a charge attack called the Thunder Sword is unlocked. The player is able to perform the attack after it's unlocked only when he has the CLAWs. The game also had a limited Co-Op option \u2013 with two controllers connected to the system, the first controller directed the craft and controlled its speed, the second fired and switched weapons. This is the first game in the series to originally released on only one platform \u2013 the Sega Genesis.</p><h3>Thunder Force V</h3><p>Following the conclusion of Thunder Force IV, the FIRE LEO-04's pilots were forced to eject after the destruction of Aceria damaged the ship. However, the <i>Rynex</i> was not destroyed. Instead it floated, adrift in space, until it reached Earth in the year 2106. The ship increased human technological development by leaps and bounds, thanks to the AI Supercomputer <i>Guardian</i>, which was designed to help Humans reverse engineer the ship, and then exploit the technology to allow Humanity to expand out into the universe. However, <i>Guardian</i> had gone (essentially) rampant. The fleet of ships that it was designing were actually intended to be warships. Once the fleet was completed, Guardian set out on its ultimate purpose \u2013 exterminating humanity. The <i>Rynex</i> had been contaminated by the reminiscent of ChaOs, which had backed themselves up within it's computers, which were in turn transferred into <i>Guardian</i>. Now, humanity's only hope lies with the pilot of the most powerful starfighter not under <i>Guardian</i>'s control, the RVR-02 Vambrace.</p><p>As this is the first game in the series to be released for disk systems (the Saturn and the PlayStation), the game uses polygonal graphics for the ships and enemies, as well as 3D graphics in the background, despite the 3D scrolling, making it a 2.5D game. As a consequence of this, the environments lack the limited vertical scrolling of the levels of Thunder Force IV. Also, rather than picking up power-up enhancements for the ship's weapons, the weapons are automatically enhanced as the character goes through the game. The game also includes as an Easter egg a several references to various bands, with bosses named after Iron Maiden, Deep Purple, and Alabama 3.</p><p>The ship can also carry an additional CLAW, now called a CRAW, bringing it to a total of 3. The CRAWs remain on screen when the ship is destroyed, giving the player an opportunity to recover them. The ship can also super-charge it's weapon attacks using the \u201cOver Weapon\u201d mechanic, by overloading the CRAWs. The game was released for the Saturn and the PlayStation, with the Saturn version having some enhanced graphical effects, and the PlayStation version adds extra art in the art gallery and CGI cut-scenes. This was the final game in the series to be developed by Technosoft, which closed it's doors in 2001.</p><h3>Thunder Force VI</h3><p>Ten years after the events of the Thunder Force V the last remnants of the ORN Empire, calling themselves ORN Faust come to Earth and overcome it's defenses. In desperation, the Unified Earth Government accesses the databanks of <i>Guardian</i> in an attempt to find a counter to this onslaught. Using the information from the Galactic Federation and the remnants of ChaOs, the Unified Earth government produces the RVR-00 Phoenix, humanity's last hope for survival.</p><p>The game was only released in Japan for the PlayStation 2. The player started out flying the Phoenix, and unlocks the Rynex-R and the Syrinx in subsequent playthroughs. The Phoenix and Syrinx don't lose any of their special weapons when they are hit, while the Rynex loses the active weapon. The game was released in 2008, and was developed and published by Sega.</p>", "guid": "3025-277", "name": "Thunder Force"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-278", "name": "Thunder"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-279", "name": "Thrillville"}, {"description": "<p>The Thief Franchise was received well by critics, and introduced new stealth mechanics to the genre.

It is said that he was inspired to create a game simulating life after he lost his home in the Oakland firestorm and his family had to relocate. He described the series as a \"virtual doll house\" to <a href=\"/maxis-software-inc/3010-205/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-205\">Maxis</a> back in 1993. The idea was met with skepticism, but <a href=\"/electronic-arts-inc/3010-1/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1\">EA</a> offered him a chance to publish it so he continued to develop the idea. The first Sims game was released on February 4, 2000 and went on to have multiple games and countless expansion packs such as, <a href=\"/sims-vacation-the/3030-1384/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1384\">The Sims: Vacation</a>, <a href=\"/sims-unleashed-the/3030-982/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-982\">The Sims: Unleashed</a>, <a href=\"/sims-superstar-the/3030-1672/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1672\">The Sims: Superstar</a>, and <a href=\"/sims-makin-magic-the/3030-8483/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8483\">The Sims: Makin' Magic</a>.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The Sims is a game where the players create virtual avatars, called Sims, and take them into a 3D world. The purpose of the game is to interact with other Sims in the game, obtain new decorations for your home and keep your Sim alive. While the Sims do certain things autonomously, the player's command will override their AI. These actions include exercise, reading, creative activities, and interacting with other Sims. Basic needs of the Sims must also be met, like going to the bathroom, personal hygiene, eating, and sleeping. If these needs aren't met the Sim will starve, wet himself, or if they don't have enough fun, they will get depressed. Each of the actions performed by the Sim changes his personality for better or worse.</p><h3>The Sims Online</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-271071\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/271071-30.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/271071-30.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-271071\"><img alt=\"The Sims Online\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/56/271071-30.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/56/271071-30.jpg 800w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/56/271071-30.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/56/271071-30.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>The Sims Online</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/the-sims-online/3030-10699/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10699\"> The Sims Online </a>was EA's plan to carry the Sims experience online and it was released in December of 2002.

Critically, it failed to capture the success of its predecessor, garnering criticism that equated it to a glorified chat room. In 2008 it was revamped into EA Land, but that did not successfully reinvigorate the game. EA then stated that EA Land would be shut down on August 1, 2008.</p><h3><b>The Sims 2</b></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/25/11329-sims2-6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-11329\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/25/11329-sims2-6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-11329\"><img alt=\"The Sims 2\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/25/11329-sims2-6.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/25/11329-sims2-6.jpg 1024w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/0/25/11329-sims2-6.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/25/11329-sims2-6.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/25/11329-sims2-6.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>The Sims 2</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/sims-2-the/3030-2473/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2473\"> The Sims 2 </a>was a fully 3D edition of The Sims that introduced many new features, as well as a story line.

This makes the gameplay very dynamic, and player focus tend to be big on which skills will prove to be the best combination for the specific challenge ahead.</p><p>This has resulted in a very active and dynamic meta-game where teams with a well thought through combination of skills on all its character almost always succeeds against a not equally well prepared foe.</p><p>ArenaNet supports the fan community by introducing weekend events and special seasonal events, these have included Halloween and Christmas themed festivities. Additionally, ArenaNet often introduces new items to the game which have unique effects on the character.</p><p> </p><h2>CORPG</h2><p> </p><p>A competitive online role-playing game (CORPG) is a type of PC Video Game with common features of most MMO's, CORPG's are often labeled as MMO's or MMORPG's due to a lack of a better term. While CORPG's and MMORPG's are very hard to tell apart because of all the similar features both of them offer, CORPG's have significant differences when it comes to Competitive Play and Tournament play, most CORPG's will offer some form of Payed Tournament system which rewards players with Real World money or Ingame Money, Items, etc which in the earlier days of Guild Wars the game did offer Cash rewards based on tournament performances.</p><p> </p><p>There is only one other developer to claim it's game is a CORPG and that was Fury which has since shut down it's servers and closed the game down due to lack of community interest and funds, the game was based solely around PvP and offered Cash rewards based on performance much like Guild Wars.</p><p>With the release of Guild Wars 2 on the horizon and Guild Wars 2 development pushing the franchise into more of an MMO / MMORPG game then a CORPG a lot of the hardcore PvP players have decided it's probably best to resist the urge of Guild Wars 2 and simply quit the game after Guild Wars 2 is released, in other words the change from CORPG to MMORPG upset the hardcore Guild Wars player base.</p><p> </p><h2>Official Blog</h2><p>ArenaNet officially began a blog on April 27th 2010 to talk discuss everything Guild Wars and also everything <a href=\"/arenanet-inc/3010-306/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-306\">ArenaNet</a>.

The series was created and designed by <a href=\"/daisuke-ishiwatari/3040-49894/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-49894\">Daisuke Ishiwatari</a>, who said he wanted to create a fighting game where every character had a unique look and fighting style, hoping to appeal to anime fans as well as traditional video game players.</p><p>After leaving vocational school, Ishiwatari pitched his idea to the head of developer <a href=\"/arc-system-works-co-ltd/3010-570/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-570\">Arc Systems Works</a>, later leading a team of 12 people to create the first Guilty Gear game. The franchise went on a brief hiatus after 2007, while Ishiwatari and ASW debuted a similar but new franchise named <a href=\"/blazblue/3025-1502/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1502\">BlazBlue</a>, though they continued updating the XX line of titles. However, the main Guilty Gear franchise re-appeared in 2014 with the release of Xrd.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>In 2180, magic is used as a power source for everything and former weapons for mankind, known as Gears, have turned on their creators. The Sacred Order of Holy Knights rose up to defend humanity from these Gears with their own magic, and managed to defeat their leader, a Gear named \"<a href=\"/justice/3005-2654/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2654\">Justice</a>.\" However, a new Gear named <a href=\"/testament/3005-3468/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3468\">Testament</a> planned to free Justice, so a tournament was held to bring forth strong fighters who would defeat this threat. A bounty hunter named \"<a href=\"/sol-badguy/3005-1071/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1071\">Sol Badguy</a>\" managed to defeat both Testament and Justice, but problems remained.</p><p>Several months later, a new \"Commander Gear\" named <a href=\"/dizzy/3005-2653/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2653\">Dizzy</a> was spotted and a bounty placed on her head for whoever could defeat her before she could lead another insurrection by the Gears. However, upon discovering that Dizzy was a little girl, Sol couldn't bring herself to kill her. <a href=\"/ky-kiske/3005-1965/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1965\">Ky Kiske</a> later found her, and turned her over to infamous pirates <a href=\"/johnny/3005-2054/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2054\">Johnny</a> and <a href=\"/may/3005-3466/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3466\">May</a> for safety.</p><p>Afterwards, with Dizzy supposedly dead to the world, more shadowy figures began plotting behind the scenes, including the \"Post-War Administration Bureau\" (PWAB) and the supposed creator of the Gears known only as \"That Man.\"</p><p>Guilty Gear 2 introduced the \"Baptisma 13 Incident,\" where a woman known only as \"Valentine,\" one who bore a strong resemblance to Sol's former lover, tried to access a Cube created by That Man and reshape the world according to the will of her \"Mother.\" Valentine controlled an army of \"Servants\" and threatened the new country of Illyria, whose king was none other than Ky. When Sol and Sin, Ky's son, rushed to the rescue, Valentine brainwashed Sin and tried to use him to access the cube. However, she was later beaten by Sol and company, even after turning into a massive Gear, before vanishing.</p><p>Despite her disappearance, more Valentines appeared in the world. Ramlethal.Valentine released a message publicly declaring war on all of humanity, while the PWAB quietly struck a deal with her to remake the world in their image. After uncovering the secret of resurrecting a dead body to life, they began their plan while Ramlethal wiped out an entire city as Sol and Ky could only watch.</p><h2>Games</h2><h3>Main Line</h3><h4>Guilty Gear (The Missing Link)</h4><p>Released in 1998 exclusively for the <a href=\"/sony-corporation/3010-3223/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-3223\">Sony</a> <a href=\"/playstation/3045-22/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-22\">Playstation</a>, this game was the first of the whole franchise. GG consisted of the first ten characters in the series (plus three more that could be unlocked in Versus Mode). It also introduced the \"Tension\" meter, which could be used for super attacks, or gambled entirely on an Instant Kill move that would instantly end the match if it hit the opponent.</p><h4>Guilty Gear X</h4><p>A sequel to the original, released on the <a href=\"/sega/3010-62/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-62\">Sega</a> NAOMI <a href=\"/arcade/3045-84/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-84\">arcade</a> hardware. Added four new characters to the game, while removing Kliff and Justice who died at the conclusion of the original game. GGX saw the returning cast's movesets drastically changed, and had a total overhaul of the gameplay mechanics, introducing the base of what the series would become. Notably, this game introduced the \"Roman Cancel\" mechanic, allowing a player to instantly cancel their move halfway through its animation to defend or use another attack instead. Also introduced was the \"Faultless Defense\" maneuver, where all damage from an attack could be negated if blocked just as it hit the character. Guilty Gear X received ports to the PC and Dreamcast.</p><p>A console port, <strong>Guilty Gear X Plus</strong>, was later released for the <a href=\"/playstation-2/3055-1917/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1917\">PS2</a>, which saw <a href=\"/kliff-undersn/3005-9389/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9389\">Kliff</a> and <a href=\"/justice/3005-2654/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2654\">Justice</a> return as unbalanced bonus console characters. This port also introduced a \"Survival\" mode, where the player was expected to fight through as many AI-controlled enemies as possible on one bar of health.</p><p>An updated release, titled <strong>Guilty Gear X ver 1.5</strong>, was made for the <a href=\"/sammy-corporation/3010-569/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-569\">Sammy</a> Atomiswave <a href=\"/arcade/3045-84/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-84\">arcade</a> hardware, and received a limited release. This version saw more overhauls of the mechanics, bringing the game more in line with its sequel, Guilty Gear XX.</p><p>There was also a portable port for the <a href=\"/game-boy-advance/3045-4/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-4\">Game Boy Advance</a> titled <strong>Guilty Gear X: Advance Edition</strong>.</p><h4>Guilty Gear X2/XX</h4><p>The most prolific version of the main Guilty Gear games, X2 has gone through no less than five updates, beginning with the original X2 (subtitled \"The Midnight Carnival\" in some editions). X2 contained 23 playable characters (3 of which had to be unlocked for versus mode play), including the original cast lists from previous GG games and four new characters. X2 introduced the \"Dead Angle Attack\" mechanic, allowing a defensive player to push an aggressive opponent away at the cost of half their tension meter.</p><p>X2 added another game mechanic used in many 2D fighting games since: the Burst Gauge. Doing so would allow a character to briefly \"burst\" the air around them and knock back the enemy, useful for defense against aggressive players. However, it could only be used once each round, and would need to fill up again before it could be used a second time.</p><p>The home version of X2 added additional modes to the game, such as:</p><ul><li>\"M.O.M.\" or \"Medal of Millionaires\": Players earn medals by performing certain combos on AI enemies, attempting to get as many as possible.</li><li>Mission Mode: Up to 50 different \"missions\" where the player must win under specific conditions, such as fighting whiile poisoned, or only being able to harm the enemy with super attacks.</li></ul><p><strong>#Reload</strong> was the first update to the game. Along with re-balancing the fighters, it re-tooled <a href=\"/robo-ky/3005-9166/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9166\">Robo-Ky</a> into an original character, selectable in the arcade release and suitable for competitive play. It also doubled the number of levels available in Mission and Survival modes.</p><p><strong>Slash</strong> was the second update to the XX series, adding two more characters to the playable roster: <a href=\"/aba/3005-3355/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3355\">A.B.A</a>, from the Guilty Gear Isuka spin-off, and <a href=\"/order-sol/3005-9171/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9171\">Order-Sol</a>, a past incarnation of Sol-Badguy with a different appearance and moveset.</p><p><strong>Accent Core</strong> saw more balance adjustments, but also saw major UI changes, and re-recorded all characters' voice clips, replacing some <a href=\"/voice-acting/3015-1413/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1413\">voice actors</a> with new ones. This update also saw new mechanics, including Slashback, a defensive mechanic acting as a <a href=\"/parrying/3015-2485/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2485\">parry</a>. Another new mechanic was the Force Break, a new set of powerful special moves costing 25% of a character's Tension meter, allowing for more offensive options for meter usage.</p><p><strong>Accent Core Plus</strong> was a console release provided as a bug fix to correct many of the errors in the prior porting job. As a bonus to purchasers, it re-added Justice and Kliff, albeit without balancing them for competitive play. Previous gameplay modes such as Survival and Mission mode were further enhanced, and a revamped Story mode continued the story from earlier XX titles. A new \"Gallery\" mode was added, including new never-before-seen illustrations for the game. An alternate voice option for Sol Badguy and Holy Order Sol was added, too, allowing players to choose either their original voice actor (series creator Daisuke Ishiwatari), or their new voice actor from Guilty Gear 2: Overture.</p><p><strong>Accent Core Plus R</strong> was the last updated version of the game, about 10 years after the original X2 was released in arcades, and five years after the release of <a href=\"/guilty-gear-2-overture/3030-22188/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-22188\">Guilty Gear 2: Overture</a>. All characters, including Kliff and Justice, were re-balanced for fair play. The HD console ports of Accent Core received this game as a free downloadable update.</p><h4>Guilty Gear 2: Overture</h4><p>A hybrid of the Real-Time Strategy genre, and the Fighting and Action genres released on the <a href=\"/xbox-360/3045-20/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-20\">Xbox 360</a> in 2007. This game saw the series transition to 3D for the first time. Taking place five-years after the original Guilty Gear, <a href=\"/sol-badguy/3005-1071/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1071\">Sol </a>and <a href=\"/ky-kiske/3005-1965/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1965\">Ky </a>are the only previously playable characters to still be selectable. Players pick characters each with unique movesets, and unique <a href=\"/minions/3015-1747/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1747\">Servants</a> to command, and must take control of strategic points around the map to allow them to create more Servants. Upon being defeated, players respawn by their Masterghosts, a defenseless main base, in exchange for some of its lifebar. Victory is achieved by depleting your opponent's Masterghost's lifebar to zero this way, or by attacking it directly. The game features <a href=\"/online/3015-559/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-559\">online</a> <a href=\"/player-vs-player/3015-346/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-346\">versus play</a> (both 1 vs. 1, and 2 vs. 2) via <a href=\"/xbox-live/3015-1404/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1404\">Xbox Live</a>, along with a story campaign. The game also received an additional playable character via <a href=\"/downloadable-content/3015-329/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-329\">Downloadable Content</a>.</p><h4>Guilty Gear Xrd</h4><p>After <a href=\"/guilty-gear-xx-accent-core-plus-r/3030-52301/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-52301\">Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus R</a> saw the series as a 2D <a href=\"/arcade/3045-84/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-84\">arcade</a> fighting game one last time, Guilty Gear Xrd returned the series to 3D. It is the first 3D fighting game in the series. Xrd was released to arcades in 2014. The game was developed in <a href=\"/unreal-engine-3/3015-86/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-86\">Unreal Engine 3</a>, but effort was made to port the existing system into UE3 in order to preserve much of the feel of the older games.</p><p>Many previous gameplay elements were removed, in an attempt to simplify the game. Slashbacks were replaced by the Blitz Shield mechanic, which has a larger window for success and is easier to capitalize off of. Force Breaks were removed entirely, leaving Overdrives as the only moves to cost Tension meter. In exchange, Roman Cancels could now be executed even if the opponent wasn't hitstun, with the addition of Yellow and Purple Roman Cancels (different from the Yellow Roman Cancels included in Accent Core's Survival mode). Another new mechanic is Danger Time, which triggers once per round randomly after two attacks clash, in which attacks have massive increases in damage and hitstun for a short time.</p><p>The initial arcade release had a playable cast of 12 returning characters, and <a href=\"/bedman/3005-28317/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-28317\">Bedman</a>, a brand new character. <a href=\"/ramlethal-valentine/3005-29128/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-29128\">Ramlethal Valentine</a> was initially an <a href=\"/non-player-character/3015-967/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-967\">unplayable</a> <a href=\"/final-boss/3015-1537/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1537\">boss character</a>, but was added in playable form to an arcade update. <a href=\"/sin-kiske/3005-4187/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4187\">Sin Kiske</a> was added to the console release, with <a href=\"/elphelt-valentine/3005-32719/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-32719\">Elphelt Valentine</a> and <a href=\"/leo-whitefang/3005-32720/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-32720\">Leo Whitefang</a> added as DLC.</p><p>The home version saw the addition of several modes, such as a Story mode, Combo Challenges, an in-depth <a href=\"/tutorial/3015-1085/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1085\">Tutorial</a>, and a revamped M.O.M. mode, which saw the previous game's M.O.M. mode combined with elements of Accent Core's Survival mode.</p><p><strong>Revelator</strong> was the first update to the game, and focused on re-balancing the game's system mechanics rather than the characters themselves. Among the system changes, Blitz Shields were altered, and Overdrives can now be powered up at the cost of the player's Burst. The visual presentation was enhanced with new shaders. The initial release of Revelator saw the return of <a href=\"/johnny/3005-2054/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2054\">Johnny</a>, and new character <a href=\"/jack-o/3005-32071/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-32071\">Jack-O'</a>. <a href=\"/jam-kuradoberi/3005-1480/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1480\">Jam Kuradoberi</a> returned in an arcade update. A character poll was held utilizing the <a href=\"/arcade/3045-84/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-84\">arcade</a> version's Player's Guild store, allowing players to earn in-game cash by playing which they could turn into votes, with the promise that the winning character would be added to the game. <a href=\"/dizzy/3005-2653/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2653\">Dizzy</a> won and has been added to the console and arcade roster as well as the new character Kum Haehyun.</p><p><strong>Revelator 2</strong> further updated the game and added two new characters to the playable roster, bringing back fan-favorite <a href=\"/baiken/3005-2522/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2522\">Baiken</a> and the previously unplayable character <a href=\"/answer/3005-34250/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-34250\">Answer</a>.</p><h3>Guilty Gear Strive</h3><p>A soft reboot of the Guilty Gear franchise and the first full new mainline title since Xrd ~SIGN~ was released in 2014.</p><table data-max-width=\"true\"><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\">Title</th><th scope=\"col\">Year</th><th scope=\"col\">Platform(s)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Guilty Gear (The Missing Link)</td><td>1998</td><td>PS1</td></tr><tr><td>Guilty Gear X</td><td>2000</td><td>ARC, DC, WIN, PS2, GBA</td></tr><tr><td>Guilty Gear X2 (The Midnight Carnival)</td><td>2002</td><td>ARC, PS2</td></tr><tr><td>Guilty Gear XX #Reload</td><td>2003</td><td>ARC, XBOX, XBL, WIN, PS2, PSP</td></tr><tr><td>Guilty Gear XX Slash</td><td>2005</td><td>ARC, PS2</td></tr><tr><td>Guilty Gear XX Accent Core</td><td>2006</td><td>ARC, PS2, WII</td></tr><tr><td>Guilty Gear 2: Overture</td><td>2007</td><td>X360, WIN</td></tr><tr><td>Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus</td><td>2008</td><td>PS2, WII, XBL, PSN</td></tr><tr><td>Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus R</td><td>2012</td><td>ARC, XBL, PSN, WIN, VITA</td></tr><tr><td>Guilty Gear Xrd -SIGN-</td><td>2014</td><td>ARC, PS3, PS4, WIN</td></tr><tr><td>Guilty Gear Xrd -REVELATOR-</td><td>2015</td><td><p>ARC, PS3, PS4, WIN</p></td></tr><tr><td>Guilty Gear Xrd REV 2</td><td>2017</td><td><p>ARC, PS3, PS4, WIN</p></td></tr><tr><td>Guilty Gear -STRIVE-</td><td>2021</td><td><p>PS4, PS5, WIN</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Spinoffs</h3><h4>Guilty Gear Petit</h4><p>Released on the <a href=\"/wonderswan/3045-65/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-65\">WonderSwan</a> in 2001. A heavily simplified fighting game, based loosely off of Guilty Gear X. It received a sequel on the same platform, <strong>Guilty Gear Petit 2</strong>, later that year. This series of spin-offs featured the exclusive character <a href=\"/fanny/3005-27557/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-27557\">Fanny</a>, a nurse who fights with a giant syringe in a way somewhat reminiscent of Faust's giant scalpel.</p><h4>Guilty Gear Isuka</h4><p>A four-player fighting game-beat 'em up hybrid released in 2003 for the <a href=\"/sammy-corporation/3010-569/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-569\">Sammy</a> Atomiswave <a href=\"/arcade/3045-84/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-84\">arcade</a> hardware. Among other major system changes, characters no longer automatically turn around due to the four-player nature of the game, and the Dust button added in <a href=\"/guilty-gear-x2/3030-8534/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8534\">Guilty Gear XX</a> has been replaced with a Turn button. Introduced the character <a href=\"/aba/3005-3355/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3355\">A.B.A</a>, who would later appear in the main series of fighting games. The console release also introduced <a href=\"/robo-ky-mk-ii/3005-4012/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4012\">Robo-Ky Mk II</a>, a fully customizable fighter. Saw ports to the <a href=\"/playstation-2/3045-19/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-19\">Playstation 2</a>, <a href=\"/pc/3045-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a>, and <a href=\"/xbox/3045-32/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-32\">Xbox</a>. The Xbox version of the game was the only port to contain <a href=\"/online/3015-559/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-559\">online play</a>. Was added to <a href=\"/steam/3015-718/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-718\">Steam</a> in 2014 as part of <a href=\"/arc-system-works-co-ltd/3010-570/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-570\">Arc System Works</a>'s ongoing effort to move their library onto the platform.</p><h4>Guilty Gear Dust Strikers</h4><p>A pseudo-sequel to <a href=\"/guilty-gear-isuka/3030-15074/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15074\">Isuka's</a> Arcade mode, released in 2006 on the <a href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-90\">Nintendo</a> <a href=\"/nintendo-ds/3045-52/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-52\">DS</a>. Retained Isuka's four-player battles and manual turning.

been 14 games made under the Guitar Hero name.\u00a0 <br/><br/> <h2>Gameplay</h2> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\"

controller.</figcaption></figure>The core gameplay of Guitar Hero is simple.\u00a0 Players must hold down colored fret buttons on the top of the guitar controller which correspond to five different colors of note gems that can appear on screen.\u00a0 When these gems cross through a bar at the bottom of the screen, the player \"strums\" the guitar's plastic bar, in lieu of plucking strings, to register the note as played and earn points.\u00a0 As the player plays more and more notes correctly, they earn a multiplier for their score, which can reach as high as 4x.\u00a0 This multiplier resets with each miss. <br/>\u00a0<br/>As the player increases in difficulty, there are a number of different variations on the basic strummed note that they could encounter.\u00a0 Notes with long tails must be held to earn maximum points; notes with white centers can be tapped quickly after playing the prior note without strumming again; pair or trios of notes must be played simultaneously, resulting in sometimes awkward hand positioning. <br/>\u00a0<br/>Players are given a \"Rock Meter,\" colored red to yellow to green, to judge their performance.\u00a0 A player completes a song by not allowing their Rock Meter to get to the bottom. <br/>\u00a0<br/>Star-shaped notes will also appear during the course of the song which, if all of them in a group are hit without a miss or an accidental strum between them, will give the player \"Star Power.\"\u00a0 Should the player earn enough Star Power, they can activate it by either tilting the top of their guitar controller upwards or by pressing Select.\u00a0 This doubles the player's multiplier, and allows for each note played to have a much higher positive effect on their Rock Meter, making it a potential lifesaver should they get into trouble. <br/>\u00a0<br/>Players can play the songs in either a free play setting or in career mode.\u00a0 While the specifics of career mode have changed from game to game, the basic premise involves playing the game's songs in increasing difficulty, ending with what is usually the most challenging song in the game.\u00a0 A stronger performance means more money is rewarded; this money can be used to buy new in-game guitars, new outfits, new characters, or unlock new songs.<br/> <h2>Timeline<br/></h2>The idea was conceived by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-3468\" href=\"/redoctane-inc/3010-3468/\" slug=\"redoctane-inc\">  RedOctane</a>, who saw the success of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-23009\" href=\"/guitarfreaks/3030-23009/\" slug=\"guitarfreaks\">  GuitarFreaks</a> in Japan and wanted to create a similar game for the western market.\u00a0 RedOctane approached <a data-ref-id=\"3010-648\" href=\"/harmonix-music-systems-inc/3010-648/\" slug=\"harmonix-music-systems-inc\">  Harmonix Music Systems</a>, who were known for music games such as <a data-ref-id=\"3030-1420\" href=\"/amplitude/3030-1420/\" slug=\"amplitude\">  Amplitude</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-5825\" href=\"/frequency/3030-5825/\" slug=\"frequency\">  Frequency</a>, and the two companies collaborated to create the original <a data-ref-id=\"3030-6311\" href=\"/guitar-hero/3030-6311/\" slug=\"guitar-hero\">  Guitar Hero</a>.\u00a0 The game proved to be a surprise hit, and a sequel, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-14916\" href=\"/guitar-hero-ii/3030-14916/\" slug=\"guitar-hero-ii\">  Guitar Hero II</a>, came out a year later, with an expansion, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-12241\" href=\"/guitar-hero-encore-rocks-the-80s/3030-12241/\" slug=\"guitar-hero-encore-rocks-the-80s\">  Rocks the 80s</a>, coming out shortly after that. <br/>\u00a0<br/>Soon after the game's release, Harmonix was purchased by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-4368\" href=\"/mtv-games/3010-4368/\" slug=\"mtv-games\">  MTV Games</a>, while RedOctane were purchased by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-78\" href=\"/activision/3010-78/\" slug=\"activision\">

 Neversoft</a>, known primarily for the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-10\" href=\"/tony-hawk/3025-10/\" slug=\"tony-hawk\">  Tony Hawk</a> series, to create future Guitar Hero titles. <br/>\u00a0<br/>The

href=\"/guitar-hero-aerosmith/3030-20684/\" slug=\"guitar-hero-aerosmith\">  Guitar Hero: Aerosmith</a> represented another new concept for the brand: a Guitar Hero game focused solely on one band.\u00a0 The game featured a majority of songs written and performed by Aerosmith, as well as the the band themselves as playable characters.\u00a0 The remainder of the track list was filled out by artists whose songs inspired or were inspired by Aerosmith. <br/>\u00a0<br/>The series also broke new ground in another way in 2008, by leaving the world of the home console for portable gaming.\u00a0 <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20639\" href=\"/guitar-hero-on-tour/3030-20639/\" slug=\"guitar-hero-on-tour\">  Guitar Hero: On Tour</a> was a game for the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-52\" href=\"/nintendo-ds/3045-52/\" slug=\"nintendo-ds\">  Nintendo DS</a>, marking the first Guitar Hero title not for a console.\u00a0 The game cartridge was fashioned into a small set of four fret buttons, similar to the plastic guitars used in the home versions.\u00a0 Players used a stylus on the DS' touch screen to strum in time with the song.\u00a0 On Tour has itself spawned two sequels, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-21102\" href=\"/guitar-hero-on-tour-decades/3030-21102/\" slug=\"guitar-hero-on-tour-decades\">  Guitar Hero On Tour: Decades</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-24920\" href=\"/guitar-hero-on-tour-modern-hits/3030-24920/\" slug=\"guitar-hero-on-tour-modern-hits\">  Guitar Hero On Tour: Modern Hits</a>. <br/><br/>The biggest jump forward for the series came with the 2008 release of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20673\" href=\"/guitar-hero-world-tour/3030-20673/\" slug=\"guitar-hero-world-tour\">  Guitar Hero World Tour</a>.\u00a0 World Tour reinvented the Guitar Hero formula, adding drums and vocals to the mix along with guitars.\u00a0 Instead of playing just the guitar track of a song, players could form full bands to play, much as in the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-567\" href=\"/rock-band/3025-567/\" slug=\"rock-band\">  Rock Band</a> series of games.\u00a0 GHWT was also the first Guitar Hero game to feature entirely master tracks of the songs in the games, not an amalgam of master tracks and recorded covers. \u00a0 <br/>\u00a0<br/>World Tour also featured GHStudio, a recording studio that could be used in the game to record tracks.\u00a0 These tracks would then also be playable in-game alongside the recorded releases from major artists. <br/>\u00a0<br/>From here, Activision started releasing Guitar Hero titles at breakneck pace.\u00a0 A second band-specific offering, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-22562\" href=\"/guitar-hero-metallica/3030-22562/\" slug=\"guitar-hero-metallica\">  Guitar Hero: Metallica</a>, was released, featuring the

sorts, taking different songs from the prior releases of games, updating them for the new four-instrument format and rereleasing them in a new package.\u00a0 Finally, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-25536\" href=\"/guitar-hero-van-halen/3030-25536/\" slug=\"guitar-hero-van-halen\">  Guitar Hero: Van Halen</a> marked the third band-centric title in the series, but despite featuring one of the more popular rock acts of all time, the game was widely panned and considered one of the weakest Guitar Hero games.<br/>\u00a0<br/><a data-ref-id=\"3030-24711\" href=\"/guitar-hero-5/3030-24711/\" slug=\"guitar-hero-5\">  Guitar Hero 5</a> was the direct sequel to World Tour, and is the most recent of the \"main\" Guitar Hero games thus far.\u00a0 GH5 refined the gameplay engine from World Tour and put more of a focus on party play, allowing players to freely drop in and out of games and, most unusually, allowing for bands that consisted of something other than the traditional guitar, bass, drums and vocals.\u00a0 GH5 also introduced a challenge system into career mode, where players could earn <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1414\" href=\"/unlockables/3015-1414/\" slug=\"unlockables\">  unlockables</a> for doing something beyond achieving a high score. <br/>\u00a0<br/><a data-ref-id=\"3030-26367\" href=\"/band-hero/3030-26367/\" slug=\"band-hero\">  Band Hero</a>, released in 2009, is a game largely similar to Guitar Hero 5, except for its tracklist.\u00a0 While Guitar Hero 5 is more of an alternative rock-focused setlist, Band Hero features more mainstream pop and rock tracks to create a more \"family-friendly\" game.\u00a0 <br/>\u00a0<br/>The latest game in the franchise, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-30014\" href=\"/guitar-hero-warriors-of-rock/3030-30014/\"

creatures and obtain character-specific bonuses. <br/>\u00a0<br/>On February 2011, Activision stated they have cancelled all future games in the Guitar Hero franchise.\u00a0 It was originally stated that all <a data-ref-id=\"3015-329\" href=\"/downloadable-content/3015-329/\" slug=\"downloadable-content\"> Downloadable Content</a> for the franchise would end after February.\u00a0 However, due to

The <i>Gundam Battle</i> series, by developer <a href=\"/artdink/3010-204/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-204\"> Artdink</a>, follows the formula of these games, <i>Lost War Chronicles</i> in particular. The games deliver a staggering amount of Mobile Suits, along with the ability to tune each suit's stats.</p><p><a href=\"/gundam-battle-tactics/3030-22606/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-22606\"> Gundam Battle Tactics</a> focuses on the <i>One Year War</i>, featuring missions based on the original <i>Mobile Suit Gundam</i> and sidestories related to that era. <a href=\"/gundam-battle-royale/3030-22614/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-22614\"> Gundam Battle Royale</a> adds <i>Zeta Gundam</i>, <a href=\"/gundam-battle-chronicle/3030-31310/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-31310\"> Gundam Battle Chronicle</a> adds <i>Gundam 0083</i>, <a href=\"/gundam-battle-universe/3030-23091/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-23091\"> Gundam Battle Universe</a> adds <i>Gundam ZZ</i> and <i>Char's Counterattack</i>, and <a href=\"/gundam-assault-survive/3030-29686/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-29686\"> Gundam Assault Survive</a> adds <i>Gundam F91</i>, <i>Gundam SEED</i>, and <i>Gundam 00</i>. Additionally, Assault Survive features interconnected battlefields and a create-a-character mode.</p><h3>SD Gundam G Generation</h3><p>The SD Gundam G Generation series is Gundam's answer to the <a href=\"/super-robot-taisen/3025-813/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-813\"> Super Robot Wars</a> series. It is a series of strategy RPGs which generally delve deep into Gundam's repertoire of Mobile Suits. The \"SD\" in the title solely refers to the super-deformed proportions of the MS featured in the game; it is in no way related to the \"SD Gundam\" anime franchise.</p><p>The G Generation games can basically be split into two groups: those which feature a crossover plot and those which allow the player to choose a series and reenact its battles. The latter type of G Gen plays like a collect-em-all strategy game, uses a square grid, and is generally made for consoles; the former type is comparable to Super Robot Wars, uses a hexagonal grid, and is usually released for handhelds. Every game released after SD Gundam G Generation: Cross Drive follows the \"console\" approach, while often creating an original subplot.</p><h3>Non-Gundam Games</h3><p>Mobile Suit Gundam was included in much of Banpresto's vast catalog of licensed crossovers from the 1990s, including the <a href=\"/the-great-battle/3025-804/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-804\"> The Great Battle</a> series and <a href=\"/battle-robot-retsuden/3030-31126/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-31126\"> Battle Robot Retsuden</a>.</p><p>It is also a mainstay in the Super Robot Wars series; every licensed game features a <i>Gundam</i> series and <i>Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack</i> is the second-most-recurring series in the franchise. The \"Banpresto Original\" pilots from Super Robot Wars 4 are classified as Mobile Suit pilots, and Cobray Gordon, the male/Real Robot protagonist of Super Robot Wars Alpha 3, uses a Mass-Production <a href=\"/rx-93-nu-gundam/3055-3689/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3689\"> Nu Gundam</a> during early stages.</p><h2>External links</h2><p><a href=\"http://www2s.biglobe.ne.jp/~ryuseik/game.htm\" rel=\"nofollow \"> List of early Gundam games</a></p>", "guid": "3025-290", "name": "Gundam"}, {"description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Tetris is a video puzzle game originally designed and programmed by <a href=\"/alexey-pajitnov/3040-9332/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-9332\">Alexey Pajitnov</a> in June 1985.

It was a three player game where players would take turns to place the various shapes, and the person to place the last piece would win. Alexey Pajitnov took this simple board game, and made two key changes. First, he changed the pentominoes to <em>tetra</em>minos by reducing the amount of squares of each block to four, and secondly, he added the all important time element that makes Tetris so popular.</p><p>In June 1985, Tetris was created by Pajitnov on an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elektronika_60\" rel=\"nofollow \">Elektronika 60</a> and soon after an improved MS-DOS version, with partner <a href=\"/dmitry-pavlovsky/3040-95247/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-95247\">Dmitry Pavlovsky</a> ,and then ported to the <a href=\"/ibm/3010-190/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-190\">IBM</a> <a href=\"/pc/3045-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a> by <a href=\"/vadim-gerasimov/3040-95246/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-95246\">Vadim Gerasimov</a>.

While they safely return from their sojourn to Xen, it is not known if the characters survive the nuclear explosion that decimates the facility.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Half-Life 2</h2><table class=\"t-editor full-width with-out-border\"><tbody><tr><td><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/24/11172-421px-HL2box.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-11172\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4228028503563\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:142.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/24/11172-421px-HL2box.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-11172\"><img alt=\"Half-Life 2\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/24/11172-421px-HL2box.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/24/11172-421px-HL2box.jpg 421w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/24/11172-421px-HL2box.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Half-Life 2\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/24/11172-421px-HL2box.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/24/11172-421px-HL2box.jpg 421w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/24/11172-421px-HL2box.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Half-Life 2</figcaption></figure>Developed by Valve, <a href=\"../../half-life-2/61-1539/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Half-Life 2</a> was released in 2004 to enormous anticipation, and emphasized the effectiveness of physics implementation as a gameplay mechanic and as a useful device to establish realism.<br/><br/>Set a number of years after the first game, Half-Life 2 starts with the G-Man awakening Gordon Freeman, who has apparently spent the last two decades within temporal stasis, neither aging nor being made aware of the events occurring in his universe. Earth has become a dystopian world, conquered shortly after Gordon's defeat of the Nihilanth in the first game by an oppressive and powerful extra-dimensional army called the <a href=\"../../the-combine/92-64/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Combine</a>. Gordon is returned to his reality as an operative of the G-Man, and is allowed to go about his business apparently unrestricted, with no knowledge of his location, situation, or the state of human society at the time. Taking place in and around the vicinity of the Eastern European-themed <a href=\"../../city-17/95-63/\" rel=\"nofollow \">City 17</a>, Gordon is soon led to the human resistance movement, which is attempting to secretly develop its own dimensional teleportation technology to strike back at the Combine. Through these events, Gordon is reconnected with colleagues and friends from Black Mesa, as well as <a href=\"../../alyx-vance/94-640/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Alyx Vance</a>, the daughter of Dr. <a href=\"../../eli-vance/94-639/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Eli Vance</a>, leader of the resistance and one of the individuals inadvertently responsible for the original resonance cascade in Half-Life. Gordon is given an unorthodox anti-gravity weapon to use in the fight with the Combine, the <a href=\"../../zero-point-energy-field-manipulator/93-20/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Zero-Point Energy Field Manipulator</a>, and the game eventually takes the player to the top of the Combine occupation's headquarters on Earth, a kilometers-tall fortress called the Citadel, where Gordon destroys the tower's dark energy reactor and initiates a massive explosion he has no hope of escaping. Fortunately, the G-Man is apparently a master of space and time, and plucks Gordon from the ensuing blast, presumably to drop him back into temporal stasis until his services are required once more.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Half-Life 2: Episode One</h2><table class=\"t-editor full-width with-out-border\"><tbody><tr><td><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/24/11173-Image-HL2EP1cover.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-11173\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.428125\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:142.8%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/24/11173-Image-HL2EP1cover.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-11173\"><img alt=\"Half-Life 2: Episode One\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/24/11173-Image-HL2EP1cover.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/24/11173-Image-HL2EP1cover.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Half-Life 2: Episode One\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/24/11173-Image-HL2EP1cover.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/24/11173-Image-HL2EP1cover.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Half-Life 2: Episode One</figcaption></figure>While not a true sequel, <a href=\"../../half-life-2-episode-one/61-14328/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Episode One</a> was the first episodic installment of the franchise, and was still hotly anticipated by fans.

Gordon is pulled back to his reality by the Vortigaunts, and from there he must quest into the center of the Citadel with Alyx to stabilize its dark energy core, temporarily preventing an explosion that could destroy the entirety of City 17 and its immediate surroundings. With that done, Alyx and Gordon must then ensure the evacuation of non-combatant citizens and then themselves escape the city, before the core overloads in a dark energy flare.

The first two games in the series had \"tank controls\", which meant that no matter where the character was on the screen pressing left and right would rotate the character in those direction, and pressing up and down would make the the character go forward or backwards. This was the accepted way for 3D games to move at the time, but by the time the third Tenchu game came out, they changed it so that controlling the character was relative to the camera.<br/><br/>In all Tenchu games your character is very limited in combat. You can attack with a 3-to-4 hit combo but your enemies block often which would make combat a big annoyance. This, as a design choice, made sneaking much more appealing because if you attack an enemy from behind they would die in one hit. Not only that, but the game would play a cool animation of your character murdering the guards with gory detail(gory for the time). In future games they would add different and multiple animations from many angles. At the time of the first two games this was seen as a reward for the sneaking but future games started to give the player additional rewards(similar to Experience Points) that would give you access to abilities(such as extra combos, zooming in, and more stealth moves).<br/><br/>The other aspect of the Tenchu game that gave them an identity was the mobility. Instead of having to run around and line up frustrating jumps(such as the gameplay in Tomb Raider which was a game with similar controls that came out at about the same time.) in Tenchu games you always had access to the Grappling Hook. With the Grappling Hook you could aim at a ledge that you'd like to climb and your character would shoot a line that would zip you up to in a few seconds. Also, the Ki Meter would give you information of where the enemies were. It consisted of a number next to a symbol. The number would represent the distance of the closest enemy and the symbol would represent to mental state of the enemy. The symbols could be ? , !? , or !!. The only one that made the enemies open for a stealth kills was the question mark which meant that the enemy was clueless, but the other two symbol was varying levels of alert and the player would have to wait till the enemies return to the question mark. This feature, along with the Grappling Hook, always made the player feel they had a grasp of the environment.<br/><br/><h2>Story</h2>The story of Tenchu revolves around a Ninja clan named Azuma. It has only two members(as far as we know) <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1590\" href=\"/rikimaru/3005-1590/\" slug=\"rikimaru\">Rikimaru</a>\u00a0and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2757\" href=\"/ayame/3005-2757/\" slug=\"ayame\">Ayame</a>.

After he killed them, he realized he is a clone of Otto Wolfgang Ort-Meyer, Lee Hong, Pablo Ochoa, Frantz Fuchs and Arkadij Jegorov. Agent 47 came back to his homeplace to find Otto using armies of 48 clones. He defeated the clones and snapped the neck of his creator. To seek peace, 47 went to Sicily. There, he met Father Emilio Vittoro. A man named Giuseepe Guillani kidnapped Vittoro. 47 rejoins the Agency to kill Guillani. Guillani was killed but Vittoro was not rescued. 47 travels to various contries including Russia, Japan, Afghanistan, Malaysia, and India to do contracts. 47 realized that Vittoro's kidnapping is a setup by Sergei Zavorokto. Sergei is a brother of one of 47's five fathers. The targets were involved in a transaction of a nuclear warhead. 47 later kills Sergei and frees Vittoro. 47 eventually becomes an assassin. At Paris, 47 killed Richard Delahunt and Alvaro D'Alvade. Just after he killed them and just before he came to a hotel, he got shot in the liver by a French police officer. 47 had a near death experience which shows screwed up editions of his memories. He was later revived by an ICA medic. He escaped the hotel, killed Albert Fournier (part of his contract) and came to the airport where he met Diana Burnwood in person. Diana informed 47 that the Franchise is a threat to the ICA yet again. The Franchise is somewhat connected to international governments and has an army of albino clones.</p><h2>Trivia</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-407198\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3107/407198-classically_exectuted.jpg\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3107/407198-classically_exectuted.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-407198\"><img alt=\"Classically Executed\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/3107/407198-classically_exectuted.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/3107/407198-classically_exectuted.jpg 800w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/3107/407198-classically_exectuted.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/3107/407198-classically_exectuted.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Classically Executed</figcaption></figure><p>The Hitman Franchise has been known for it's graphic violence and dark tones. <i><a href=\"/hitman-blood-money/3030-11004/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11004\">Hitman: Blood Money</a></i> is arguably the most violent game in the series to date, however, it wasn't the actual game that came under fire by the media, but its advertising campaign.</p>", "guid": "3025-306", "name": "Hitman"}, {"description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Created by <a href=\"/relic-entertainment/3010-1804/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1804\">Relic Entertainment</a>, the Homeworld franchise is a series of <a href=\"/space/3035-50/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-50\">outer space</a> <a href=\"/games/?sort=release_date&amp;filter_type=genre&amp;filter_value=12/\">real-time strategy</a> games for the <a href=\"/pc/3045-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a> first introduced in 1999. One of the hallmarks of the franchise is its fully three-dimensional gameplay, which allows for unit movement in three axes rather than on a single two-dimensional plane. At present, the series spans three titles: 1999's <a href=\"/homeworld/3030-11590/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11590\">Homeworld</a>, 2000's <a href=\"/homeworld-cataclysm/3030-14029/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14029\">Homeworld: Cataclysm</a>, and 2003's <a href=\"/homeworld-2/3030-9473/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9473\">Homeworld 2</a>. Homeworld and Homeworld 2 were both developed by series creator Relic, while Cataclysm was developed by<a href=\"/rockstar-vancouver/3010-2737/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2737\"> Barking Dog Studios</a>; all three games were published by <a href=\"/sierra-entertainment-inc/3010-1030/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1030\">Sierra Entertainment</a>. Homeworld has been a well-received series overall, and critical praise of the first game in particular was quite ebullient, including several \"Game of the Year\" awards. In addition, the game sold in excess of 500,000 copies. Later titles in the series also earned high marks from reviewers, and across all three games the franchise was often commended for having a cinematic presentation, complete with attractive visuals and audio, a strong, story-focused single-player component, and novel gameplay elements when compared to other contemporary RTS titles.</p><p>In August of 2004, roughly a year after the release of Homeworld 2, Relic Entertainment was purchased by <a href=\"/thq/3010-15/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-15\">THQ</a> for approximately ten million dollars. The status of the franchise in the years following this acquisition was uncertain, as Sierra Entertainment still held the rights to the Homworld IP. In September of 2007, however, a rumor began to circulate that THQ was in talks with <a href=\"/vivendi-games/3010-6398/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6398\">Vivendi</a>, Sierra's parent company, to purchase the rights to the Homeworld franchise. In November of the same year, a THQ spokesperson commented on the rumor, stating that THQ did in fact have the rights to the franchise, though no mention was made of a deal with Vivendi. Furthermore, THQ was quick to point out that no Homeworld games were currently in development at that time. Since then, a number of Relic employees have made positive comments about the possibility of a third Relic-developed Homeworld game, though, to date, no announcements concerning future titles have been made.</p><h2>Plot</h2><h3>The Homeworld War (Homeworld)</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2320259-the_guidestone.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2320259\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5703125\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:57.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2320259-the_guidestone.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2320259\"><img alt=\"The Guidestone of Kharak\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/118253/2320259-the_guidestone.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/11/118253/2320259-the_guidestone.png 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11/118253/2320259-the_guidestone.png 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/118253/2320259-the_guidestone.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>The Guidestone of Kharak</figcaption></figure><p>Inhabiting the desolate Outer Rim desert world known as Kharak, the Kushan people survived for thousands of years in the most inhospitable of conditions. One fateful day, however, a large object was detected beneath the sands of Kharak, one that would unite the warring Kushan Kiithid in an unprecedented endeavor. What they found beneath the dunes was the wreckage of an ancient spacefaring vessel; more interesting than that, an important artifact lay within it, which came to be called the Guidestone. Etched upon the stone was a map indicating that the inhabitants of Kharak were in fact native to another planet, <a href=\"/hiigara/3035-1459/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1459\">Hiigara</a>. United by their desire to rediscover their lost homeworld and the origin of their people, the clans of Kharak put aside their differences in order to undertake a massive construction initiative that would last some sixty years before its completion. The result of this effort was the Kushan Mothership, a massive self-sufficient colony ship designed to allow the Kushan to navigate the stars and ultimately find their home. At its helm is the scientist <a href=\"/karan-sjet/3005-1803/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1803\">Karan S'jet</a>, who volunteered to have herself permanently integrated into the ship in order to act as Fleet Command.</p><p>Any sense of accomplishment the Kushan may have felt after successfully completing the Mothership is quickly curtailed, however, as Kharak is unexpectedly attacked while the crew of the Mothership is performing a hyperspace test on their new vessel. The Mothership returns to the Kharak system to find the planet consumed by fire and the Mothership's scaffolding destroyed, and what little remains of the planet's population is contained in a small number of orbital cryo trays. Gathering the last denizens of Kharak before they leave the system, the Mothership's crew sets out to gather strength and eventually confront the Taiidani who were responsible for the attempted genocide at Kharak. Along the way, they acquire new allies in the form of the Bentusi, a race of intergalactic traders who help educate the Kushan on their heritage. They learn from them that their people had once belonged to a powerful galactic empire; 3,000 years prior they were exiled to the Outer Rim, and their home planet, Hiigara, was now occupied by the Taiidan Empire. After an arduous journey and many tribulations fighting a number of different foes, the Kushan are able to confront and defeat the Taiidan in order to retake Hiigara.</p><h3>The Beast War (Homeworld: Cataclysm)</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2320260-the_taiidan.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2320260\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.6328125\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:63.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2320260-the_taiidan.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2320260\"><img alt=\"After the Homeworld War, the Taiidan fracture into two groups: Imperialists and Republicans.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/118253/2320260-the_taiidan.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/11/118253/2320260-the_taiidan.png 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11/118253/2320260-the_taiidan.png 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/118253/2320260-the_taiidan.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>After the Homeworld War, the Taiidan fracture into two groups: Imperialists and Republicans.</figcaption></figure><p>Fifteen years after the monumental victory that allowed them to resettle their home planet, the Hiigarans have returned to their old ways as the Kiithid struggle amongst themselves for technological and political power. Kiithid without sufficient influence on the Daiamid, the Hiigaran governing body, are largely left to fend for themselves. The Kiith Somtaaw, one of the more marginalized Hiigaran clans, carves out an existence for itself through deep space mining while scavenging technology from any available source, including the Bentusi. Though a smaller Kiith, they are able with the aid of other Kiithid to secure the rights to the HIigaran Mothership construction facilities for a brief period, during which time they build two Mothership class mining vessels, the Kuun-Lan and the Faal-Corum, and a single science vessel, the Clee-San. Though not considered a warrior Kiith, the Somtaaw are called upon to defend against an attack by Taiidani Imperialists in 15 AHL. After the assault is successfully repulsed, the Kuun-Lan is directed to track down and assist the damaged Kiith Manaan Destroyer, the Bushan-Re, and after doing so the Somtaaw detect an artifact projecting a faint signal beacon.</p><p>Bringing the artifact aboard proves to be disastrous, as before long a mysterious infection begins to spread, forcing the Kuun-Lan to jettison parts of the ship. Though the Kuun-Lan is saved, the bio-mechanical virus responsible for the infection, which would later be called the Beast, continues to infect other ships. With no discernible way of defeating such an opponent, the Somtaaw flee and attempt to warn Hiigara of this new threat. Complicating matters further, the remnants of the old Taiidan Empire choose to ally themselves with the sentient Beast virus in order to reap the potential spoils of their conquest. Within Koreth's Rift, however, the Somtaaw discover an ancient Siege Cannon, and with help from the Bentusi, they are able to convert it into a weapon which the Kuun-Lan can use against the Beast. After using this armament to destroy the Beast's Mothership, which had formed around the Kuun-Lan's infected hangar module, the Somtaaw eventually challenge and destroy the Naggarok, the alien ship that was the source of the virus, once again with the aid of the Bentusi. Afterwards, they are lauded by the Daiamid and became known as the \"Beast Slayer\" clan in honor of their efforts.</p><h3>The Vaygr War (Homeworld 2)</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2320257-hyperspace_core.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2320257\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:50.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2320257-hyperspace_core.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2320257\"><img alt=\"The Hiigaran Hyperspace Core\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/118253/2320257-hyperspace_core.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/11/118253/2320257-hyperspace_core.png 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11/118253/2320257-hyperspace_core.png 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/118253/2320257-hyperspace_core.png 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Hiigaran Hyperspace Core\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/118253/2320257-hyperspace_core.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/11/118253/2320257-hyperspace_core.png 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11/118253/2320257-hyperspace_core.png 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/118253/2320257-hyperspace_core.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Hiigaran Hyperspace Core</figcaption></figure><p>One hundred years after the conclusion of the Beast War, the Hiigarans would face yet another threat, this time in the form of a nomadic group of warriors called the Vaygr. Though the Vaygr tribes had long been known for their propensity for merciless conquest, the discovery of the Third Hyperspace Core by the warlord <a href=\"/makaan/3005-1905/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1905\">Makaan</a> transforms them into something far more deadly. With it, the Vaygr are able to Far Jump, traveling vast distances with incredible speed, and using his link to the Hyperspace Core as proof of his superiority, Makaan is able to unite the Vaygr tribes toward a common purpose: the complete domination of the galaxy. Believing himself to be the Sajuuk-Khar, a mythical individual foretold to unite the three Hyperspace Cores and reawaken a godlike being known as Sajuuk, Makaan leads the Vaygr in a crusade to recover the other two Hyperspace Cores and fulfill the prophecy. As the Vaygr's bloody campaign draws ever closer to Hiigara, the Daiamid is faced with the inevitability that the Kiithid must once again band together in order to defend themselves. With this in mind, a new Hiigaran Mothership, the Pride of Hiigara, is commissioned with the utmost secrecy.</p><p>Despite their best efforts, however, the Vaygr catch wind of the Hiigaran's intentions and arrive at the Tanis Shipyards hoping to destroy the Mothership and obtain the Hiigaran's Hyperspace Core at the same time. The Mothership has just enough time to escape intact and return to Hiigara in order to collect the rest of its crew, but afterwards they have little choice but to cede their home system to the Vaygr. Without the military might to challange the Vaygr, they turn to Shipyard Nabaal for reinforcements, and after defending it successfully they are contacted by their old allies, the Bentusi, who inform them of the prophesy of the End Times, which Makaan wishes to bring about through warfare. The Bentusi, who also possess one of the three Hyperspace Cores, set them on a course to recover Progenitor technology that might aid them. In part because of their acquisition of Progenitor ships, the Hiigarans experience increasing success against the Vayger, and ultimately Makaan is defeated at Balcora before he is able to activate Sajuuk, which is revealed to be a massive Progenitor starship. Activating Sajuuk themselves, the Hiigarans use the vessel to break the siege of Hiigara and unlock an intergalactic hyperspace network.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>General Gameplay</h3><p>One of the most noticeable attributes of all three Homeworld games is the option to move in all directions; a normal movement command will simply direct a unit along a two-dimensional plane, whereas by holding the Shift key while issuing a movement order units can also be commanded to move up or down along the z-axis. The ability to take full advantage of three-dimensional space plays an important part in gameplay, as there are very few objects within environments that truly restrict movement. As such, success in combat is often a matter of making sound tactical decisions such as choosing the appropriate unit formations and attacking ships where they are most vulnerable. Powerful Capital ships, for instance, may be vulnerable from the side or the rear but extremely deadly when faced directly, and Fighter squadrons may be able to increase their effectiveness by having their tactics or formations adjusted to suit the particular type of foe they are facing.</p><p>Building a fleet of ships in Homeworld is done through construction vessels such as the Mothership, which are typically vulnerable and slow-moving. Though the franchise does not feature <a href=\"/base-building/3015-1307/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1307\">base building</a> per se, these production facilities can be thought of as a player's headquarters, and they represent a significant disadvantage if lost. In single-player, loss of the Mothership usually results in immediate mission failure. Production ships also act as repair stations, resource drop points, and docking facilities for smaller ships. In later games, they are also centers for research into new ship designs and upgrades for existing ships. Ships are built using Resource Units, or RUs, which are the one consistent resource throughout the series. Resource Units are gathered from raw materials by Resource Collectors and dropped off at the nearest production vessel or resource collection unit, at which point they can be used to fund new ships, modules, or research initiatives.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2320258-shipyard_assault.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2320258\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2320258-shipyard_assault.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2320258\"><img alt=\"Combat encounters in Homeworld often include vessels of various sizes.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/2320258-shipyard_assault.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/11/118253/2320258-shipyard_assault.png 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11/118253/2320258-shipyard_assault.png 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/118253/2320258-shipyard_assault.png 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/2320258-shipyard_assault.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Combat encounters in Homeworld often include vessels of various sizes.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/2320258-shipyard_assault.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/11/118253/2320258-shipyard_assault.png 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11/118253/2320258-shipyard_assault.png 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/118253/2320258-shipyard_assault.png 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/2320258-shipyard_assault.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Combat encounters in Homeworld often include vessels of various sizes.</figcaption></figure><p>All combat-class units in the Homeworld series are divided into categories that directly correspond to their size. The smallest class is referred to as Strike ships, which is further subdivided into the smaller Fighter class and the larger Corvette class; Strike ships are the fastest and most maneuverable class, and while they do not hold up under sustained fire, many vessels do not have weaponry capable of targeting such small, agile ships reliably. Above Strike ships in size are Frigates, which are significantly slower and more cumbersome than Fighters and Corvettes but also much harder to destroy. Lastly, Capital ships, referred to as Super Capital ships in some instances, are extremely large vessels that, while sluggish, are often bristling with weaponry and incredibly hard to destroy without significant firepower. Even within classes the utility of ships can vary widely depending on their design, and other non-combat ship classes exist as well to fill roles such as <a href=\"/resource-gathering/3015-975/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-975\">resource gathering</a> and reconnaissance.</p><p>In terms of interface, Homeworld is primarily mouse-driven, with some of the more common game commands being attached to keyboard <a href=\"/hotkey/3015-351/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-351\">hotkeys</a> as well. Units can be selected by clicking on them individually or drag-selecting to select an entire group. Homeworld's camera system uses ships as a focal point, and the player can rotate around the current focal point by holding the right mouse button and dragging the mouse. Scrolling the mouse wheel in or out will zoom the camera in or out respectively, and designating a new focal point for the camera is accomplished by selecting a new unit (or units) before pressing the F key. All games in the series feature a Sensors Manager interface as well, accessed by pressing the space bar, which zooms the camera out to present a much wider view of the overall play area. Most normal actions and commands can be carried out from this interface, with the main advantage of the Sensors Manager being the ability to assess and conduct activities over a large expanse.</p><h3>Single-Player</h3><p>The structure of Homeworld's single-player remains fairly consistent across all titles in the franchise. In all cases, players are presented with a linear set of missions, and certain objectives must be met within each mission in order to progress to the next. Levels may include multiple objectives, and the nature of these may vary greatly from one mission to the next. As an RTS, gathering resources and building a larger offensive force is a common theme throughout; unlike many RTS titles, however, units and resources in Homeworld are carried forward from one mission to the next, allowing players to gradually build the strength of their fleet over time. Technological advancements and ship-building capacity acquired in previous missions are persistent as well. The Homeworld games also feature a number of common presentational elements, such as black-and-white, hand-drawn cutscenes between missions. The narrative is additionally progressed through liberal use of in-game voice-overs and in-engine cutscenes.</p><h3>Multiplayer</h3><p>Every iteration of the Homeworld franchise has featured a multiplayer component, which includes both skirmish modes against <a href=\"/bots/3015-597/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-597\">bots</a> and and competitive modes against other players. Homeworld and Cataclysm both shipped with a number of different game types and adjustable options for multiplayer, as well as support for up to eight concurrent players. Homeworld 2, by comparison, shipped with a single game type, Deathmatch, fewer customization options, and support for only six concurrent players, and as a result drew criticism from some fans. Gameplay mechanics change little during multiplayer, though objectives are naturally more geared toward defeating opponents than completing objectives, as is the case during single-player. Homeworld multiplayer was at one point in time supported by WON.net, an online gaming service provided by Sierra, though with the closure of this service in 2008 emphasis has shifted to third-party solutions such as GameRanger and Hamachi.</p><h2>Games</h2><h3><a href=\"/homeworld/3030-11590/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11590\">Homeworld</a> (1999)</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11423/1058320-homeworld_front.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1058320\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"900\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 900px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11423/1058320-homeworld_front.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1058320\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-width=\"640\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/11423/1058320-homeworld_front.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/11423/1058320-homeworld_front.jpg 900w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/11423/1058320-homeworld_front.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/11423/1058320-homeworld_front.jpg 640w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/11423/1058320-homeworld_front.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/11423/1058320-homeworld_front.jpg 900w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/11423/1058320-homeworld_front.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/11423/1058320-homeworld_front.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-width=\"640\"></noscript></a></figure><p>The debut title for Relic Entertainment, Homeworld was released in 1999 to tremendous critical acclaim. It was heralded by many in the gaming media for having a strong visual and audio presentation, an engaging story-driven single-player campaign, and a unique three-dimensional twist on traditional RTS gameplay. The reception to Homeworld was strong enough that it prompted the release of a special Game of the Year Edition, which included a CD soundtrack, in order to commemorate the many accolades it had amassed. Of the three Homeworld games released to date, the original is the most highly rated in terms of aggregate review scores, and later games in the series would follow closely in its footsteps.</p><h3><a href=\"/homeworld-cataclysm/3030-14029/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14029\">Homeworld: Cataclysm</a> (2000)</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/24362/917459-catc.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-917459\" data-ratio=\"1.219512195122\" data-width=\"410\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 410px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:122.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/24362/917459-catc.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-917459\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 524px) 100vw, 524px\" data-width=\"524\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/2/24362/917459-catc.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/2/24362/917459-catc.jpg 410w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/2/24362/917459-catc.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/2/24362/917459-catc.jpg 410w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 524px) 100vw, 524px\" data-width=\"524\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Released less than a year after the original, Homeworld: Cataclysm, developed by Barking Dog Studios, was positioned as a stand-alone expansion pack for Homeworld. It uses the same engine as its immediate predecessor, though a few additional graphical embellishments have been added. In addition, a considerable number of interface tweaks and gameplay alterations are introduced. This includes smaller changes, like the option to issue attack orders from the Sensors Manager, as well as more far-reaching ones, such as the inclusion of Support Units that govern the player's ability to construct new ships. The factions of the previous game were also scrapped in favor of two new ones, the Kiith Somtaaw and the Beast.</p><h3><a href=\"/homeworld-2/3030-9473/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9473\">Homeworld 2</a> (2003)</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5370/1452190-hw2_us.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1452190\" data-ratio=\"1.41875\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:141.9%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5370/1452190-hw2_us.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1452190\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 451px) 100vw, 451px\" data-width=\"451\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/5370/1452190-hw2_us.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/5370/1452190-hw2_us.jpg 640w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/5370/1452190-hw2_us.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/5370/1452190-hw2_us.jpg 451w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/5370/1452190-hw2_us.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/5370/1452190-hw2_us.jpg 640w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/5370/1452190-hw2_us.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/5370/1452190-hw2_us.jpg 451w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 451px) 100vw, 451px\" data-width=\"451\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Almost exactly four years after Homeworld's release, Relic delivered Homeworld 2 as the first official sequel to the original game. Unlike Cataclysm, Homeworld 2 represented a significant overhaul in terms of its graphical presentation. Many new interface enhancements were added as well, including the ability to scroll the camera by moving the cursor to the edges of the screen. Gameplay mechanics were also modified in some cases; for example, producing ships within a certain class now requires that the appropriate production facility be built on the Mothership. Once again, the game features two new factions, the Hiigarans and the Vaygr, though many ships designs from the first game survive more or less intact.</p><h2>Raider Retreat</h2><p>Originally released as a bonus disc for purchasers of Homeworld: Cataclysm, Homeworld: Raider Retreat is a shortened demo version of the original Homeworld that contains five single-player missions. Four of these missions were included in the final game, however the fifth, which involves a Hiigaran assault on two Turanic Raider Carriers, cannot be found elsewhere. In addition to these single-player missions, Raider Retreat includes a tutorial mission, skirmish mode, and multiplayer. In commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the Homeworld franchise, Relic released a free downloadable version of Raider Retreat in September of 2009, which is currently available from various sources.</p><h2>From THQ to Gearbox</h2><p>After THQ went bankrupt in 2012 they had to sell off all the IP's the publisher owned.

Tak and Lok are both apprentices of Jibolba, Tak being the younger of the two, but after Lok is turned into a sheep, it's Tak's turn to take the quest of restoring his friend to his human form. Tak's mentor Jibolba sends him off to find the Spirit Rattle, which will channel the Juju spirits to assist Tak on his journey. Tak was guided by Flora, a daughter of the Moon Juju. He was also tasked to find 9 Magical Nubu Plants When Tak returns with the Spirit Rattle and Plants, he learns that Lok has been killed by a herd of sheep, and that he must now find some way to resurrect him. Unfortunately, Tak unintentionally resurrected Lok's squire, Tobar. He must do this by collecting 100 Yorbels and Lok's spirit from the spirit world. Once Lok is revived he's plagued with diarrhea or resurrection's revenge, and Tak is sent off to recover the 3 Moon Stones while Lok recovers from his ailment. It's these Moon Stones that will restore the Moon Juju to full strength. After collecting all 3 of the Moon Stones, the Moon Juju is finally restored to her former strength and it is revealed that Lok isn't the warrior from the prophecy as was originally thought. It turns out that Tak fits the profile better since he has restored the Moon Juju. Now that he's outfitted with an arsenal of Juju spells that he collected along his journey, all that remains is for him to defeat Tlaloc. He does this by turning the villain into a sheep, naturally. Tlaloc is now defeated and the rams like him.</p><p> </p><h3>Tak 2: The Staff of Dreams</h3><p>Tak had been asleep for 16 days since his last adventure. He had a dream when the Dream Juju told him to defeat the Dream Guardian, take the Staff of Dreams and rescue the princess. Tak was later guided to a rift. He was woken up by Lok's smelly BO. Jibolba tasked Tak to find his brother JB and he transformed into a flea. Lok wanted to come too. Tak and Jibolba reached a dead end and summoned the Belly Juju for making a raft. But first, Belly Juju wanted a barrel of candy. Tak later used the barrel as a raft. At the rapids, Tak returned to the Dream World. Tak went into another rift. Tak let Lok provide a distraction to the Woodies. Tak summoned the Mind-Reader Juju who told him to find 3 magic stones as bolas. Tak was later knocked out and sent to the Dream World. Tak was sent to a rift and woke up in the Gloomleaf Arena. Caged Juju asked Tak what is in the box. Tak guessed many times until he thought there was nothing in the box. Inside the box was Lok. Tak took a key to battle 4 waves of woodies. He uses a catapult to escape. In the swamp, Tak saw Dead Juju being harrassed by woodies who took his tiki. Tak goes back to the arena and steals the Tiki back from the Woodie King. Dead Juju agrees to go with Tak, Jibolba and Lok. At the exterior of JB's Planetarium, Tak and his friends were sleeping due to the flowers. At the Dream World, Tak uses a catapult to break the Dream Guardian's tower. He went back to a rift and woke up. Tak and Jibolba left Lok and Dead Juju behind. At JB's planetarium, JB needed help with the Power Parasites. After the battle, JB helped Tak go to sleep but never heard of a Dream Juju. At the tower in the dream world, Tak defeated the Dream Guardian and rescued the princess. But the princess was actually Pins and Needles. The Dream Juju was also revealed to be Tlaloc (in his sheep form). Tlaloc used Tak to defeat the Dream Guardian so he can steal the Staff of Dreams. Tak and Pins and Needles struggled for the staff but it broke into two and they were sent into the real world. Needles used the Staff of Nightmares to create a rift. Tak was later knocked out. In his dream, he was met by the Moon Juju to pick one of four spirit animals. She was about to say the best one (which is jaguar), but lost connection. Tak picked an animal and woke up with new powers. Tak met the Giant Misunderstanding Juju to open a rift. The Juju thought he wanted to talk to Rick. Rick told Tak to ask him if he wants to talk to Rick. The Juju finally opened a rift. Tak told him goodbye but the Juju decided to sing a song. Moon Juju's daughters, Flora and Fauna gave Tak the power to transform into a bear, a squirrel, a boar and a frog. Tak chased Pins and Needles constantly until Tak went into the Dream Fortress. When Tak defeated Pins and Needles, Lok grabbed the Staff of Nightmares and unintentionally gave it to Tlaloc. Tak battles Tlaloc but both became Dream Guardians. After the battle Tak apologizes to the Dream Guardian and gives the full Staff of Dreams back. The Dream Guardian helps Tak return to reality. Dead Juju, Lok and Tak give Tlaloc the final blow. It has been revealed that the events are a dream. Tak slept for 16 days and told Jibolba and Lok about the story. Tlaloc's evil black sheep came running towards them. It has been implied that the events will happen.</p><p> </p><h3>Tak: The Great Juju Challenge</h3><p>Jibolba summons someone and tells that person that the Pupanunu Tribe are hosting the Great Juju Challenge which happens every 60 years. Jibolba wanted to see if Tak and Lok would come back. In Feathercrag, Tak and Lok are looking for a Phoenix to grab a feather to go to the Juju Challenge. Two unknown men took the feather. Tak and Lok are summoned by the Moon Juju to introduce the teams: Team Grammazon, Team Jibba Jabba, Team Black Mist (The two unknown men) and Team Pupanunu (Tak &amp; Lok). After the first 3 challenges, the Black Mist had been eliminated. The Black Mist came back at the Shaman Snack Shack when they messed up the scores at the Two-Headed Juju. After 3 more challenges and a proving ground match, Flora and Fauna found Grammazon teeth on the Salt Lick of Performance Enchancement which eliminated the Grammazons. Before the next match, Tak and Lok see Black Mist talking to an unknown Juju to find Moon Juju. After the next 3 matches and a proving ground match, Jibba Jabba got eliminated. Team Black Mist wanted to burn the Pupanunu village and \"Crug\" talked with Moon Juju and reminded her of someone else. At the Gates of Nocturne, Tak and Lok found Crug and revealed they cheated with Dark Juju. At Caster's Hill, Crug wasn't there. At Ambush Grove, they found Crug on the floor who defeated an invisible lizard and gave Lok the Ancient Hammer of Handy Juju. At the final proving grounds, Dark Juju reveals himself and announces his love to Moon Juju. After three rounds, Team Pupanunu won. They returned to the Shaman Snack Shack but nobody was there to begin a party except Jibolba. So they did a high-five.</p><p> </p><h3>Tak: Mojo Mistake</h3><p> </p><h3>Tak and the Guardians of Gross</h3>", "guid": "3025-311", "name": "Tak"}], "version": "1.0"}
