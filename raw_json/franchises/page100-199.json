As federal agent <a data-ref-id=\"3005-688\" href=\"/ethan-thomas/3005-688/\" slug=\"ethan-thomas\">Ethan Thomas</a>, the player walks through a variety of dilapidated and foreboding buildings. Most enemies in the game are psychotic in nature and will viciously attack the player on sight.</p><p>Although firearms are present in the series, Condemned games place a strong emphasis on improvised melee weaponry. Players can find a variety of brutal weapons around the game's environments, like axes, lead pipes, 2x4s, and more. Using the triggers, players can either swing or block with these weapons.</p><p>The hallmark of the series is the way in which these melee battles are presented. Fights in Condemned are up-close and often very jarring. As enemies attack, the camera snaps back as if to absorb the impact of the blow, and wavers as Ethan regains his composure. Likewise, striking an enemy causes them to recoil under your force and yell in agony. These fights have made the game slightly notorious in the media, but in general the Condemned series' extreme violence has very rarely been under any scrutiny.</p><h2>Sequel Controversy</h2><p>Condemned 2: Bloodshot was released for the Xbox 360 (which the original was released on) as well as the PS3. Although many critics gave the game positive reviews, many fans took exception to the game's increasingly surreal and supernatural elements. The most scrutinized feature in the sequel is a late-game power that allows you to explode people's brains by shouting. In addition, the latter portions of the game required shooting sections instead of the physical combat the series is so noted for. This led to a feeling of a letdown in comparison to the original. Some, however, found these changes made the game more intriguing and fresh.</p>", "guid": "3025-104", "name": "Condemned"}, {"description": "<p>Squad tactics in contemporary settings!</p>", "guid": "3025-105", "name": "Conflict"}, {"description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-691170\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19490/691170-conkers_pocket_tales.jpg\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19490/691170-conkers_pocket_tales.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-691170\"><img alt=\"The Kid-Friendly Conker of Conker's Pocket Tales.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/19490/691170-conkers_pocket_tales.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/19490/691170-conkers_pocket_tales.jpg 500w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/19490/691170-conkers_pocket_tales.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-width=\"640\"></a><figcaption>The Kid-Friendly Conker of Conker's Pocket Tales.</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/conker/3005-316/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-316\">Conker</a> was originally a kid-friendly character.

Their objective was to modify \"the multiplayer aspects of Half-Life to bring to it a more team-oriented gameplay\". In the early days they compared their mod to footage of Team Fortress 2 that was shown in May at E3 1999. Counter-Strike pits a Terrorist and Counter-Terrorist squad against each other. Both teams have access to different weapons that are obtained through a buy system. Money is rewarded to players based on their performance. Depending on the map, objectives can range from planting explosives in a designated bombsite, rescuing hostages or eliminating the opposing team. When the first version of Counter-Strike was release it included four maps (cs_siege, cs_mansion, cs_wpndepot, cs_prison), nine guns (usp, glock, shotgun, m4a1, mp5 navy, TMP, awp, G3/SG-1 &amp; FN M249 PARA) and weighed in at 7.5 megabytes. Not until Beta 4.0 were bomb planting missions introduced. One year after the original release of Counter-Strike, the mod included twelve official maps and nineteen weapons. On top of that, the mod also had a thriving community producing many user created maps and various other content including skins and server side mods. By 2000, Counter-Strike was the most played Half-Life based game. <br /></span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>On April 12, 2000, it was announced that the Counter-Strike developers and Half-Life developers, Valve were teaming up. Counter-Strike left the beta phase November 8, 2000. It was available on store shelves as a standalone game, but continued to be available online for free as a Half-Life mod. The current version of Counter-Strike, 1.6 was released September 15, 2003 along with the Steam client. Before Steam, Counter-Strike was played on the WON online gaming service by Sierra Games.

Four months earlier on March 21, 2004, Counter-Strike: Condition Zero (abbreviated CS: CZ or just CZ) was released. CS:CZ contain the core Counter-Strike 1.6 gameplay, but included updated maps, models, textures and various other tweaks. Condition Zero was the first release of the series to include bots and a single player mode. Also included was Condition Zero: Deleted Scenes. Deleted Scenes is the creation of previous CZ developers Ritual Entertainment. The original intended release was Ritual\u2019s single player campaign including standard Counter-Strike multiplayer. After seeing average pre-release reviews in the 60% range, Valve pulled the plug on Ritual\u2019s Condition Zero and the project was handed over to Turtle Rock</span><span>Studios. Even after Turtle Rock reworked and released their version, Condition Zero received an average score of 65% according to Metacritic. Despite this, today Condition Zero is one of the most played games</span><span>available via Steam. To stimulate sales, during July of 2004 Valve announced that owners of Condition Zero would be given limited-time beta access to Counter-Strike: Source</span><span>(abbreviated</span><span>CS:S)</span><span>. CS:S was the</span><span>next installment in the Counter-Strike franchise completely remade using Valve\u2019s Source Engine. The game was bundled along with Half-Life 2, acting as the initial multiplayer portion until the release of Half-Life 2: Deathmatch. Counter-Strike: Source was later released as a standalone game available via Steam or retail. Much like early beta versions of Counter-Strike, initial versions of CS:S only included one player model for each team. Over time additional features have been added including a \u201cDynamic Weapons Pricing\u201d (although most servers choose not to utilize this feature), bots, additional maps and an enhanced radar system. <br /></span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Valve have been tight lipped about any potential additions to the Counter-Strike franchise. In an interview with GameTrailers TV, Valve\u2019s director of marketing Doug Lombardi stated \"With Counter-Strike 2, there's a big question between, do we go start over from scratch and build this whole new game, do we do something that looks more like Team Fortress 2 that is rooted in the old game but has a ton of new stuff, or do we just sort of take everything that's new that we've released and put that out in a new box\". He continues \"I think we're leaning more towards the two more radical places than just sort of rolling up the new box and reskinning the box and putting out all the new stuff.\"</span></p>", "guid": "3025-114", "name": "Counter-Strike"}, {"description": "<h2>Hosts of the video game show</h2><h3>Nate Shapiro</h3><p>Voice Actor: <a href=\"/harry-gottlieb/3040-19441/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-19441\">Harry Gottlieb</a></p><h3>Buzz Lippman</h3><p>Voice Actor: <a href=\"/peter-b-spector/3040-19401/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-19401\">Peter B.

He stated that during said traffic jam, he saw an empty lane and wanted to drive through it with a \"Good feeling.\" He pitched the idea of a game where players assumed the role of a taxi driver to his development team, thought this was met with some resistance.

The player will be given less and less time to drive customers to destinations, and traffic will steadily increase. This subtle shift in difficulty balanced out the mechanic of earning extra time for skilled play, it encouraged replay and thus, coin-feeding.</p><p>Gameplay aside, Crazy Taxi\u2019s licensed soundtrack and in-game advertising was its definitive feature. A soundtrack consisting of three Bad Religion songs and three songs from The Offspring, and frequently visited destinations such as Pizza Hut and KFC, ensured that players of Crazy Taxi consumed a lot of punk rock and junk food.</p><h3>Crazy Taxi 2 (2001)</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1486/1117426-nulldc_1_2009_08_11_04_41_26_03.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1117426\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1486/1117426-nulldc_1_2009_08_11_04_41_26_03.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1117426\"><img alt=\"\"></a><figcaption>\"Yah Yah Yah Yah Yah\"</figcaption></figure><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1486/1117422-nulldc_1_2009_08_11_04_29_09_82.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1117422\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1486/1117422-nulldc_1_2009_08_11_04_29_09_82.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1117422\"><img alt=\"The \"><noscript><img alt=\"The \"></noscript></a><figcaption>The \"Crazy Hop\" really did change the strategy of the formula.</figcaption></figure><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><a href=\"/crazy-taxi-2/3030-18195/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18195\">Crazy Taxi 2</a> was the final Crazy Taxi game to be released on the Dreamcast, at that same time, the original game was ported on the PlayStation 2 and later on, the Gamecube. Every gameplay method that was feature in Crazy Taxi was in Crazy Taxi 2, with a new layer of depth added to the formula. Crazy Taxi 2 added four new cab drivers to chose from, the cab drivers from the original do return as unlockables.</p><p>Two new cities were created (heavily based on <a href=\"/new-york/3035-109/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-109\">New York</a>). A new gameplay element known as the \"Crazy Hop\" was added. The crazy hop is done with the push of a button, it helps the player in huge traffic jams that the player has trouble getting through. And the game gives the player the ability to pick up two to four costumers at once.</p><p>The way the both cities are structure defiantly makes good use of the crazy hop. There's a extensive amount of short-cuts that have to be taken in order to get to the desired location on time - which consist of jumping on roof-tops, though sometimes you will be jumping from one highway bridge, to another. When the player is driving to the destination, he or she must quickly examine the environment to know if there's a short-cut that can be taken. Certain short-cuts are pretty obvious, such as the arrow that naviagates you is pointing towards a short roof-top, but sometimes it can be a bit more complacated than that.</p><p>Multiple passengers can be picked up at once. Once the player does so, he or she must drop them off in different locations. The amount of money that increases for doing stunts will get multiply by the number of costumers the player has. But the player has to be careful on which location to head to first, he or she must keep in mind on which location is the closes first, and then do the same for the next locations. The new layer of depth does make Crazy Taxi 2 more difficult than the original.</p><h3>Crazy Taxi 3: High Roller (2002)</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/29889/1141752-crazytaxi3_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1141752\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.66480446927374\" data-width=\"716\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 716px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/29889/1141752-crazytaxi3_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1141752\"><img alt=\"Crazy Taxi 3.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/29889/1141752-crazytaxi3_2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/2/29889/1141752-crazytaxi3_2.jpg 716w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/2/29889/1141752-crazytaxi3_2.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/29889/1141752-crazytaxi3_2.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Crazy Taxi 3.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/29889/1141752-crazytaxi3_2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/2/29889/1141752-crazytaxi3_2.jpg 716w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/2/29889/1141752-crazytaxi3_2.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/29889/1141752-crazytaxi3_2.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Crazy Taxi 3.</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/crazy-taxi-3-high-roller/3030-8316/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8316\">The third game</a> added nothing new to the gameplay, and as a result, the critical reception was harsh on the third installment.

Made up of a three-episode trilogy, Xenosaga is set in the same universe as Xenogears and is inspired by the same Gnostic philosophies and concepts that drove the original PlayStation title. The Xenosaga series was originally planned out as a six-game story arc, but due to various factors was reduced to a three-part narrative.</p><p>Xenosaga tells a science fiction tale set in humanity's distant future, long after the human race leaves Earth for the stars. Its narrative is spread across a large cast and delves into a variety of subplots.</p><h2>Naming</h2><p>Each game in the trilogy features a subtitle derived from three of the major works from the nineteenth century philosopher Friedrich Wilhem Nietzsche, with which the games share some of their themes and ideas. Central to the games are biblical references, and the plot sometimes tarries with the notion of God and revolves around the destiny of humanity. Also, the question of humanity itself--what is it?--is realized through the existence and development of KOS-MOS.</p><p>Another notable fact is that the games take their names from Nietzsche's work in reversed chronological order. Friedrich Nietzsche first published Also Sprach Zarathustra and then Jenseits von Gut und B\u00f6se. Der Wille zur Macht, the subtitle of Xenosaga Episode I, was published after Nietzsche's death without his consent, and it has long been established that it is not the form in which he intended the work to be published. Conversely, Nietzsche considered Also Sprach Zarathustra, the subtitle for Xenosaga Episode III, his most important work.</p><h2>PAL Release</h2><p>Episodes I, II, and III were all released in Japan and North America. However, in PAL territories, only Episode II was released. Because customers in PAL-territories did not have regular access to the first game in the series and thus would not know the events that occurred prior to Episode II, Sony and Namco released the title as a 'Limited Collectors Edition' that contained an additional DVD with all the cutscenes from the first game. The DVD has a play time of some three hours.</p>", "guid": "3025-119", "name": "Xenosaga"}, {"description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Premiering in 1993, this series of computer games were published by Mythos Games and MicroProse.

Initially introduced to Japanese arcades on the 21st of November 1998 as part of their <a href=\"/bemani/3025-708/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-708\">Bemani</a> franchise, Dance Dance Revolution was unique in how players used their feet to play the game. The latest arcade version is simply titled Dance Dance Revolution, although most players refer to it as Dance Dance Revolution 2014 due to its lack of subtitle. The last home version released was <a href=\"/dance-dance-revolution-ii/3030-35735/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-35735\">Dance Dance Revolution II</a> in 2011. </p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Dance Dance Revolution is typically played using four panels, arranged with panels pointing up, down, left and right on top of a 'dance platform'. The dance platform, a raised metal surface, there are two sets of panels to allow for either two players to play at once, or for advanced players to use both sets of panels. The player is shown a set of arrows near the top of a video screen that correspond to the respective arrow panels on the dance platform. Additional arrows rise from the bottom of the screen to meet these arrows, and when they pass over the top arrows, the player hits the corresponding panel with their feet. Points are awarded for how well timed the press is; the better the timing of the player, the more points they score. Timings are grouped together, and every time the player hits (Or misses) an arrow, the game gives the player a judgement level. These vary from 'Marvelous', the most accurate timing level that is only available in specific versions of DDR, to 'Perfect', 'Great', 'Good', 'Boo', 'Miss' and 'OK. Players also have a Dance Gauge, a form of life bar that decreases should they miss any arrows, and increases if they correctly hit other arrows. Should the Dance Gauge reach zero, the player either recieves an instant game over, or the machine waits until the end of the song where it ends the players game. This varies dependant on the game version, game mode or operator settings on the arcade machine itself. At the end of a song, the player is given a rating. The highest rating is a AAA, where, excluding versions of the game with the Marvelous timing level, the player has to get a Perfect rating for every step in the entire song.</p><p>DDR features different types of arrows; there are standard arrows, that just need to be stepped at the right time, freeze arrows, that need to be held until the game indicates to let go, and as of DDRX, shock arrows, a horizontal line of arrows that cause the player to lose energy from the Dance Gauge, break their combo of sucessful arrow steps and also hides the arrows on the screen for a brief moment, but only if the player has a foot on the panel as it passes the target arrows at the top of the screen. DDR also features various different game modes. Standard play involves the player selecting songs of their own choice to play on the machine. This normally allows for three songs to be played, providing the player does not recieve a game over, however it is possible in some versions to achieve certain scores that allow for as many as two extra songs to be played. These songs normally take the form of Extra Stage, where the arrows scroll from the top of the screen to the bottom a 1.5 times the normal speed, and One More Extra Stage, where the player cannot miss a single arrow or the game ends straight away.</p>", "guid": "3025-127", "name": "Dance Dance Revolution"}, {"description": "<br/>", "guid": "3025-128", "name": "WWE SmackDown!"}, {"description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Darius is a side-scrolling shoot-em-up franchise, similar to the <a href=\"/r-type/3025-419/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-419\">R-Type</a> or <a href=\"/gradius/3025-261/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-261\">Gradius</a> franchises.

This flew in the face of the unwritten fighting game law that chain combos were meant to cancel out of normal moves and lead straight into special moves.</p><p> </p><p>The new and improved chain combos in \"<a href=\"/night-warriors-darkstalkers-revenge/3030-9542/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9542\"><i>Night Warriors Revenge</i></a>\" lead to the possibility of using regular moves to chain together an amazing array of hits. The system also found it's way to the \"<i><a href=\"/capcom-versus/3025-568/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-568\">Capcom Versus</a></i>\" series. The system worked by using light punch to start the chain, working to medium punch and then finishing with heavy punch all in quick and timed succession. The same process could be started going from light-medium-heavy kick.</p><p>In \"<a href=\"/night-warriors-darkstalkers-revenge/3030-9542/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9542\"><i>Night Warriors Revenge</i></a>\" each character was granted their own follow up attack by pressing up and punch while an opponent was on the ground.

ES moves worked as modifiers to the standard special moves. Once the player had filled up a special bar they could perform an ES move. Instead of pressing the punch or kick button to execute the special move, they would press two punch or kick buttons instead (Like<i> <a href=\"/street-fighter-iv/3030-20456/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20456\"> Street Fighter IV</a></i>). This would result in an ES version of that special move. ES moves often changed the entire dynamic and animation of the move, allowing the player to have access to an array of different moves for different situations. It is also important to note that \"follow up attacks\" were also eligible to be used in ES form.</p><p>In \"<a href=\"/night-warriors-darkstalkers-revenge/3030-9542/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9542\"> Night Warriors Revenge</a>\" the special gauges could be banked for later use, meaning once one filled up, it was stored away while another started to fill. The EX attacks (which in the first <a href=\"/darkstalkers-the-night-warriors/3030-16793/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16793\"> Darkstalkers</a> were refereed to as SP moves) can be thought of as proper supers/ultras in <a href=\"/street-fighter-iv/3030-20456/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20456\"> Street Fighter IV</a> terms. The EX attack would use one entire special bar like an ES move would, but would require a totally different input to execute.</p><p> </p><p>In 1997 <a href=\"/darkstalkers-3/3030-1541/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1541\"> Darkstalkers 3 </a>(\"Vampire Savoir\" In Japan) brought about major changes to the health bar system and is considered by many the best game in the series.

Games in this series not only give the player the ability to move in any direction, they require the player to use all three axes of movement to progress through each level. The control scheme for moving and rotating in full 3D space is easily learned, but new players can initially become disoriented, or even nauseouted without any kind of artificial horizon or a designated up and down.</p><p> </p><h2>Franchise History</h2><p>Descent was originally created by Parallax Software for Interplay, the team consisting of ex-Looking Glass Studios employees using a new engine based on concepts they had learned by working on Ultima Underworld.</p><p>The first game was developed over 21 months with a budget of $450.000 and was originally supposed to be published by Apogee, but who pulled out as the development turned too lenghty and expensive. A deal was eventually signed with Interplay to publish the game and helped them hire additional 3D artists and level designers. It was released as a shareware title on December 24, 1994 featuring 7 maps, followed by a full retail release in March 1995 and enhanced ports for Mac and PlayStation some months later.</p><p>Descent II followed in 1996 using the same engine with some enhancements, new enemy types and a Guide-Bot to help new players navigate the 3D environments.</p><p>Parallax split into <a href=\"/deep-silver-volition-inc/3010-1007/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1007\">Volition </a>and <a href=\"/outrage-games/3010-2213/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2213\">Outrage Entertainment </a>after the release of Descent II's Vertigo expansion, with Volition's next project being a larger scale, traditional space combat sim, <a href=\"/descent-freespace-the-great-war/3030-10309/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10309\">Freespace</a>. The first Freespace, released in 1997, got Descent branding in some territories, though aside from some minor references, had a completely unrelated story line.</p><p>Meanwhile, Outrage developed <a href=\"/descent-3/3030-2903/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2903\">Descent 3</a>, with a new engine capable of handling 3D acceleration and outdoor environments. It was released to critical acclaim in June 1999, but was not commercially successful.</p><p>After Descent 3 the franchise was dropped for over a decade. Volition made occasional references to it in their Red Faction and Saints Row games, but no new games were made up until the 2015 Kickstarter by <a href=\"/descendent-studios/3010-11497/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-11497\">Descendent Studios</a> (consisting mostly of former Freespace developers).

The stories force the player to discover the truth (which usually leads to the relativist conclusion that truth is a contingent condition), forcing the player to make moral choices in order to proceed. Although the player's progression through both games is linear, the Deus Ex games, especially the first one, employ a so-called<a data-ref-id=\"3015-453\" href=\"/sandbox/3015-453/\" slug=\"sandbox\">             \u00a0sandbox</a>\u00a0level design which allows the character to reach the end of a given area in any way they choose. A classic example comes in the second level of the first game, where the NSF, a homegrown terrorist organization, has taken several New Yorkers hostage and strapped them to explosives. The options are numerous: you can go in guns blazing and try to kill the terrorists before they trigger the bomb, you can climb down a subway ventilation shaft and drop in behind them, you can buy an <a data-ref-id=\"3055-1730\" href=\"/emp-grenade/3055-1730/\" slug=\"emp-grenade\">   EMP grenade</a> and short-circuit the lasers that trigger the bomb, or you can just let the hostages die.

However, after a significant amount of development time the game was considered to be too much of a departure from the classic Resident Evil formula to carry its name. Instead of scrapping the project completely, <a href=\"/capcom/3010-367/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-367\">Capcom</a> instead decided to continue development of the game under a different name. Development of <a href=\"/resident-evil-4/3030-1578/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1578\">the new Resident Evil title</a> was handed over to the Creator/Director of the original Resident Evil, <a href=\"/shinji-mikami/3040-32999/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-32999\">Shinji Mikami</a>, and Kamiya continued work on what became Devil May Cry.</p><p>As you might expect, Devil May Cry features many technical similarities to the older Resident Evil games, as well as some general presentation trademarks of several Capcom and Mikami games. The game features the same <a href=\"/fixed-camera/3015-1715/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1715\">fixed camera</a> viewpoint (a feature that is still met with mixed reviews to this day), as well as the trademark \"You Are Dead\" <a href=\"/game-over/3015-372/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-372\">game over</a> screen and the \"This game contains scenes of <a href=\"/extreme-violence/3015-1042/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1042\">violence</a> and <a href=\"/gore-system/3015-2259/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2259\">gore</a>\" start up warning screen, all of which had originated from <a href=\"/resident-evil/3030-5842/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5842\">Resident Evil</a>, with the latter being included in countless M rated Capcom games, including <a href=\"/dead-rising/3030-8720/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8720\">Dead Rising</a>, <a href=\"/killer7/3030-18347/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18347\">Killer 7</a>, <a href=\"/dino-crisis/3030-11917/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11917\">Dino Crisis</a> and <a href=\"/onimusha/3025-467/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-467\">Onimusha</a>. Despite being a new and (at the time) unproven series, Devil May Cry would not stay in Resident Evil's shadow for long, being both critically praised and commercially successful, and helping to pioneer the 3D <a href=\"/hack-and-slash/3015-469/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-469\">Hack and Slash</a> and \"Character Action\" genres.</p><p>Wanting to capitalize on Devil May Cry's success, Capcom decided to take an unrelated game being helmed by <a href=\"/hideaki-itsuno/3040-40227/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-40227\">a different director</a> that was currently in development and have it overhauled into a sequel to Devil May Cry. Released less than a year and a half after the original, <a href=\"/devil-may-cry-2/3030-16741/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16741\">Devil May Cry 2</a> was received much poorer by reviewers and fans alike, many seeing it for the cash grab that it was. Despite stellar sales close to the original, Capcom decided to play it safe and give the next entry in the series more time in development than its predecessor.</p><p>Despite DMC2's critical panning, Hideaki Itsuno returned to direct <a href=\"/devil-may-cry-3-dantes-awakening/3030-890/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-890\">Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening</a>. Much attention was paid to the criticisms DMC2 received, and the developers responded to them by making the combat in DMC3 tighter, faster and more punishing, much like the original title in the series. The story was also designed as a response to criticisms about DMC2's story and Dante's character in said game. A prequel to the original game, DMC3 showed a younger, cockier Dante and explored the relationship he had with his brother <a href=\"/vergil/3005-1804/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1804\">Vergil</a>, who played a minor role in the first game. Devil May Cry 3 was released to critical acclaim, and fans saw the game as both a worthy successor and a huge improvement to the original game. <a href=\"/devil-may-cry-3-special-edition/3030-48692/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-48692\">A special edition of the game</a> was later released that allowed fans to play as Vergil, though only new intro and ending cutscenes were made, the rest of the game identical to Dante's campaign with the cutscenes taken out. This version also retuned the difficulty, which was infamously increased for the American and European releases in response to complaints about DMC2's difficulty. The difficulties levels are now all equivalent with the original Japanese version's.</p><p>In early 2008 Devil May Cry made its first generational leap with the release of <a href=\"/devil-may-cry-4/3030-6681/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6681\">Devil May Cry 4</a> on both PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and a PC later in the same year. DMC4 introduced a new protagonist, <a href=\"/nero/3005-662/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-662\">Nero</a>, who players control for the first half of the game. Dante does appear in the game, first as an antagonist and then as a player character after the halfway point. Devil May Cry 4 was met with mixed reviews, with the combat being a high point but the second half of the game being met with criticism for featuring Dante going through the same levels Nero had gone through during the first half. Despite criticisms, Devil May Cry 4 quickly became the best selling entry in the series, and one of Capcom's best selling games overall.</p><p>On September 15th for the Tokyo Game Show, a new CG trailer (apparently non-gameplay) was released for \"DMC,\" the fifth game in the Devil May Cry series. It features a short-haired protagonist (who apparently has an affinity for smoking) who shares many of the combat traits as Dante (dual handguns plus melee). One sequence in the trailer seems to indicate that you will also be able to use an extending grappling hook of some sort, at the very least to swing around objects in the environment. This game was eventually released as <a href=\"/dmc-devil-may-cry/3030-32686/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-32686\">DmC: Devil May Cry</a>. Developed by <a href=\"/ninja-theory/3010-3909/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-3909\">Ninja Theory</a>, this was the first game in the series developed outside of Capcom, and was designed as a reboot to the series. The game was met with critical acclaim by reviewers but was received notoriously poorly by fans of the series, who saw the gameplay as much shallower than the original series and didn't care for the new interpretation of Dante.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1227811-devil_may_cry__dante.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1227811\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.3353115727003\" data-width=\"337\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 337px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:133.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1227811-devil_may_cry__dante.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1227811\"><img alt=\"Dante, the protagonist in most of the games and the only character to be playable in every entry of the series.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/4527/1227811-devil_may_cry__dante.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/4527/1227811-devil_may_cry__dante.jpg 337w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 479px) 100vw, 479px\" data-width=\"479\"></a><figcaption>Dante, the protagonist in most of the games and the only character to be playable in every entry of the series.</figcaption></figure><p>The main plot of Devil May Cry revolves around <a href=\"/dante/3005-309/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-309\">Dante</a>, who's mother was murdered by <a href=\"/demons/3015-557/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-557\">demons</a>.

In any particular mission there are two teams, that of the player and the computer. The player has the oppurtunity to move all of their units and have their unit undertake an action (use item, attack etc) before their turn ends and the computers turn begins, the two teams take turns in this way with the ultimate goal <em>usually</em> being to defeat all units in the other team.</p><p>Each mission begins from a central hub, where the player can recruit new characters to the party based on experience each character has earned in battle, current characters can be healed at the hub and new items can be bought with money earnt in battles.</p><p>There is also an Item World gateway; here, the player can select any item in the party's inventory and enter it. The levels for an item are randomly generated but depend on a number of factors based on the item itself such as its rarity or power. By descending through the Item World, the player can improve the abilities of the item as well as free Guardians that live in the item. These Guardians impart certain benefits to the item, such as increased in attack or defense values, and once they are freed, they can be moved between items freely.</p><p>Each Mission in the Disgaea series follows a basic pattern.</p><p>Initially the player selects which characters they will use (from a portal) and moves them around the map, the player can plan actions with these characters (once an action has taken place the character cannot move) and when they use the \"Execute\" function all planned actions will take place (in the order they were planned). If the player has not used all of there characters, that is to say some may still perform actions, their turn continues, if they have no characters left with actions remaining there turn ends (turns can also be ended manually).</p><p>Once the players turn has ended the computer takes a turn (the computers units begin on the map, they do not exit from a portal initially like the players). There is a chance that the players (or computers) characters will counter attack when attacked, adding a level of strategy to who should be attacked, likewise when a character attacks whilst standing next to another ahracter on there team there is a chance for a combo where 2 (or more) characters will attack at once whislt only using one characters action.</p><p>These turns continue until one team is defeated (or a different objective is met).</p><p>Across some boards are glowing colored spaces and special objects called \"Geo Symbols\". When these are placed on a colored field, they impart a bonus or penalty to all battle participants on the same colored field; such bonuses can also stack if multiple Geo Symbols are on the same field. A character can destroy a Geo Symbol which will cause all the field spaces it affects to cause some damage to the characters on them as they turnto another color determined by the destroyed Geo Symbol. It is possible to arrange a chain of these effects, each chain increasing the amount of damaged earned and increasing the bonus score for the mission. As with characters, Geo Symbols can also be lifted and thrown as to affect the board's bonuses.</p><p>Character towers can also be made with the lift ability, reflecting Disgaea's quirky attitude.</p>", "guid": "3025-152", "name": "Disgaea"}, {"description": "<p>The Dizzy games by Codemasters were a series of games following Dizzy; a boxing-glove wearing egg; and his family, the Yolkfolk.</p><div><br /></div><div>Although the games primarily started as a solo puzzle/adventure game, some of the later games branched off to be more arcade-like, with games akin to Pac-Man and Tetris - similar to the branching out which the Mario games have taken in recent years.</div><div><br /></div><div>The main series played like a cross between a text-adventure with platforming elements.

Many people refer to the game as \"Diddy Kong's Quest\" missing the pun on the word \"conquest\" in the game's actual title. Donkey Kong has been captured by K. Rool, this time using the name Kaptain K. Rool, and it is up to Diddy Kong and newcomer <a href=\"/dixie-kong/3005-303/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-303\">Dixie Kong</a> to rescue him. The effect that this story had on the gameplay was slightly controversial at the time, as some players were disappointed that Donkey Kong is not playable at any point in the game. Despite this seemingly huge change, Diddy's Kong Quest retained most gameplay elements from the original while introducing many more.</p><p>The system of switching between Kongs at any point is still prevalent. Diddy Kong plays much like he did previously, and Dixie Kong's unique ability to slow her descent by spinning her pony tail continues the element of strategy. Animal buddies return, some from Donkey Kong Country and others being original to Diddy's Kong Quest. A new ability to actually transform into some of these animals rather than simply ride on top of them was featured in a few levels, and new non playable Kongs were introduced to the overworld screens such as stylish trivia show host <a href=\"/swanky-kong/3005-14642/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14642\">Swanky Kong</a>.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5692/232250-diddy_dixie.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-232250\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.87843137254902\" data-width=\"255\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 255px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.8%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5692/232250-diddy_dixie.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-232250\"><img alt=\"Diddy carrying Dixie near a bonus room barrel.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 255px) 100vw, 255px\" data-width=\"255\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/5692/232250-diddy_dixie.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/5692/232250-diddy_dixie.jpg 255w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Diddy carrying Dixie near a bonus room barrel.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/5692/232250-diddy_dixie.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/5692/232250-diddy_dixie.jpg 255w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 255px) 100vw, 255px\" data-width=\"255\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Diddy carrying Dixie near a bonus room barrel.</figcaption></figure><p>An extreme amount of hidden secrets, tokens, and bonus rooms can be found in the game. Although highly praised by both critics and players as a whole, a criticism of Diddy's Kong Quest was that it contained too many collectibles. Tokens were used in exchange for services, which included traveling to and from the various main areas and even saving game progress. Purely optional to the completion of the game, a \"Lost World\" was introduced and arguably contained some of the most difficult levels in the history of the series.</p><p>A considerably darker overall theme is featured in Diddy's Kong Quest. The game takes place on an island belonging to K. Rool, called <a href=\"/crocodile-isle/3035-2206/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2206\">Crocodile Isle</a>. Sinking pirate ships, damp swamplands, haunted forests and crumbling castles are just a few of the game's atmospheric locations. These locations are accompanied by an equally mysterious soundtrack again composed by Dave Wise, some of the most notable tracks being <i>Stickerbrush Symphony</i> and <i>Bayou Boogie</i>.</p><h3>Donkey Kong Country 3</h3><p><b>The Heroes:</b> Dixie Kong &amp; Kiddy Kong</p><p><b>The Kongs:</b> Cranky Kong, Wrinkly Kong, Funky Kong, Swanky Kong</p><p><b>The Brother Bears:</b> Bazaar, Barnacle, Brash, Blunder, Blue, Bazooka, Bramble, Blizzard, Benny &amp; Bj\u00f6rn, Barter, Baffle, Boomer, Bachelor</p><p><b>The Good Guys:</b> Ellie the Elephant, Enguarde the Swordfish, Squawks the Parrot, Squitter the Spider, Parry, Nibbla</p><p><b>The Bosses:</b> Belcha, Arich, Squirt, Bleak, Barbos, KAOS</p><p><b>The Final Boss:</b> Baron K.

The game continues the theme of promoting a <a href=\"/sidekick/3015-422/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-422\">sidekick</a> character from the previous title to become the star of the next title. Donkey and Diddy Kong are missing after going on a vacation, so Dixie Kong and cousin <a href=\"/kiddy-kong/3005-1651/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1651\">Kiddy Kong</a> are tasked with finding their location. Kiddy Kong was not as well received by players as a newcomer in comparison to Dixie in Diddy's Kong Quest, and Double Trouble's return to a relatively generic theme and style was criticized. A simple inventory system was brought into the series, along with \"The Brothers Bear\" who will offer services to Dixie and Kiddy.</p><p>Again the gameplay is similar to that of its predecessors. The player must complete various levels, finding bananas and secrets along the way, and defeat a boss at the end of each main area to advance to the next one. The game's overworld, the <a href=\"/northern-kremisphere/3035-1886/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1886\">Northern Kremisphere</a>, was more interactive than in previous installments, featuring different vehicles to explore the land and \"banana bird\" caves that could be found in usually difficult-to-reach locations. The soundtrack was mostly composed by Eveline Fischer, with Dave Wise assisting. A notable piece of trivia is the cameo of a <a href=\"/nintendo-64/3045-43/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-43\">Nintendo 64</a> in Wrinkly Kong's Save Cave. A song from <a href=\"/super-mario-64/3030-2931/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2931\">Super Mario 64</a> can be heard in the background as well.</p><h3>Donkey Kong 64</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3699/689144-donkeykong64.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-689144\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.69032258064516\" data-width=\"620\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 620px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:69.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3699/689144-donkeykong64.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-689144\"><img alt=\"All in 3D\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/3699/689144-donkeykong64.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/3699/689144-donkeykong64.jpg 620w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/3699/689144-donkeykong64.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/3699/689144-donkeykong64.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"All in 3D\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/3699/689144-donkeykong64.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/3699/689144-donkeykong64.jpg 620w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/3699/689144-donkeykong64.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/3699/689144-donkeykong64.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>All in 3D</figcaption></figure><p>Released in 1999, <a href=\"/donkey-kong-64/3030-15000/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15000\">Donkey Kong 64</a> marked the first time the series went 3D and to a new console.

Donkey Kong 64 was the first game to require the Expansion Pak.</p><p>It is regarded as one of the biggest and longest single player videogames ever created, due to it's very large amount of collectibles and missions for the player to complete. The game was well received by fans and critics alike and went on to become a Nintendo 64 Player's Choice title.

It was one of the earliest TV series to be computer-animated. The show portrays Donkey Kong as the main protagonist who lives in an island called the Kongo Bongo. His mission is to protect a magical coconut called the Crystal Coconut from the evil clutches of King K.

The goal with Doom was to improve upon the Wolfenstein formula in both graphic quality and game play. Even though Wolfenstein had in some cases crossed the status quo of gaming by fighting <a href=\"/nazis/3015-113/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-113\">nazis</a> and zombies, Doom pushed the envelope further by showing <a href=\"/satanism/3015-2091/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2091\">satanic</a> imagery, increased <a href=\"/gore-system/3015-2259/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2259\">gore</a>, and <a href=\"/demons/3015-557/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-557\">demons</a> as actual enemies, which provoked a lot of religious countries.

He appears to be very angry that the forces of hell have invaded his reality, which is understandable. He grits his teeth while shooting them, and is constantly on the look for more demons to murder. He seems to enjoy using weapons, as he shows a completely badass grin whenever he picks up a new one. He has a pet rabbit, which was tragically killed sometime before the final cutscene of the \"Inferno\" episode of Doom, appearing decapitated and with her head on a stick as a human city burns. However, he got revenge by killing lots of demons that invaded Earth, in the \"Thy Flesh Consumed\" episode of <a href=\"///\">Ultimate Doom</a>. Later, the Doom novels would give the character the name \"Flynn Taggart\", though the novels are of dubious canonicity.</p><h3>Reception</h3><p>It is estimated that the original shareware version of Doom had been installed on over 10 million computers by 1995. Doom II, which was not released as shareware, sold over 2 million copies.</p><p>As the success was rising so was the attention of those who would use the game as a poster child to show how video games were \"destroying\" or \"corrupting\" those who played video games. This was especially a hot topic after the Columbine High School incident in 1999 - at the time, the largest school shooting in American history. Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the two teenage killers, had been reported to have played Doom countless times to cope with anger or frustrations. It was also thought that Eric Harris had made levels in which he recreated Columbine High School to use as a sort of school shooting simulator. This was merely a rumour, while Harris did make Doom maps, none of them were like a classroom or school. Doom became a target, along with music artists such as <a href=\"/marilyn-manson/3040-89633/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-89633\">Marilyn Manson</a> and violent movies, for a country attempting to explain the motivation for the killings.</p><h2>Sequels</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4865/217334-938819522_00.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-217334\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4865/217334-938819522_00.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-217334\"><img alt=\"Blast more demons back to Hell\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/4865/217334-938819522_00.gif\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/4865/217334-938819522_00.gif 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Blast more demons back to Hell\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/4865/217334-938819522_00.gif\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/4865/217334-938819522_00.gif 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Blast more demons back to Hell</figcaption></figure><p>With the initial success of Doom, <a href=\"/id-software/3010-347/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-347\">id Software</a> decided to put out a sequel to further improve the new established series. <a href=\"/doom-ii-hell-on-earth/3030-621/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-621\">Doom II: Hell on Earth</a> was the name of the sequel and it was not that much different from it's predecessor. The game still used the Doom engine and was essentially the same game just with a different story, newer enemies, and the <a href=\"/double-barreled-shotgun/3055-655/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-655\">double barreled shotgun</a> as a new weapon. Doom II was released October 10th 1994, except this one would actually have to be purchased as it was retail. Much like the first one, Doom II was successful and went on to sell over 2 million copies.</p><p>Two years later, id Software made another installation of the franchise: <a href=\"/final-doom/3030-750/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-750\">Final Doom</a>. Like Doom II before it, this sequel merely had a new story and maps. There were no new monsters or weapons. This one was considered a challenge Doom game for those who had beaten Doom II in its hardest difficulty.

To the great surprise and disappointment of the franchise's fans, <i>Doom 3</i> was a survival horror game, not a straight-out action game as its predecessors were. This game utilized the new <a href=\"/id-tech-4-engine/3015-1383/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1383\">id Tech 4 engine</a>, which had been in development for quite some time.</p><p>The game was moderately well received, and an expansion pack was released entitled <a href=\"/doom-3-resurrection-of-evil/3030-7754/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7754\"><i>Doom 3: Resurrection</i> <i>of Evil</i></a>. The expansion had brought back the fan-demanded double-barrelled shotgun and the new grabber weapon, which was inspired by <a href=\"/half-life-2/3030-1539/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1539\"><i>Half Life 2</i></a>'s <a href=\"/zero-point-energy-field-manipulator/3055-20/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-20\">Gravity gun</a>. In terms of story it continued right after <i>Doom 3</i>, with a new playable character, and even had the last boss be a key villain character from <i>Doom 3</i>.</p><h2>Legacy and Future</h2><p>The Doom franchise continued in May 2016 with the release of a long-in-development reboot of the series, simply titled <a href=\"/doom/3030-20654/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20654\">Doom</a>.</p><p>The Doom franchise has been essential to the development and popularity of the FPS genre - in particular \"Run 'N' Gun\" shooters. The series also became such a landmark in gaming, that a film was created bearing the same name. The film was not what fans of the series had hoped for, and it was not that well received by both fans and critics. Despite the movie, the lasting legacy of Doom has not only impacted the idea of what it meant for a game to be \"run and gun\", but the popularity of video games in general, especially on the PC. If someone were to compare its impact on games with a more modern game series from today, one could say <i>Doom</i> and <i>Wolfenstein 3-D</i> did to FPS's what the <a href=\"/grand-theft-auto/3025-6/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-6\"><i>Grand Theft Auto</i></a> series has done for the sandbox genre.</p><p>Doom is still greatly popular today, as people continue to play enhanced versions through <a href=\"/source-port/3015-4367/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4367\">source ports</a> such as Zdoom and Skulltag, along with creating mods or WAD files for the series. With its lasting impact on video games in general, the Doom series is often hailed as one of video gaming's best and many believe the first two game's to be considered important to the further advance in video games as a whole or a popular culture.</p><h3>Source Ports</h3><p><i>Main article:</i> <a href=\"/source-port/3015-4367/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4367\"><i>Source Port</i></a></p><p>In 1997 the Doom source code was released to the public. It has lead to numerous 'source ports' including online multiplayer ports such as Skulltag, graphically enhanced versions with new textures and OpenGL support, and ports replicating the original Doom engine on modern hardware like Chocolate Doom.</p><h3>PWAD</h3><p>The most common add-on for Doom and Doom II are PWADs. WAD is an acronym of Where's All the Data? PWAD, or Patch WAD, is a file containing settings which can redefine or add content to the IWAD (Internal WAD - the core game data).</p><p>PWADs are loaded after IWADs and will therefore override the games default settings or add additional parameters. Custom maps are loaded as PWADs.</p><h2>Trivia</h2><ul><li>John Carmack, the creator of Doom, claims that the inspiration for the name of the original game came from the 1986 Tom Cruise movie The Color of Money. In a scene where Cruise's character Vincent Lauria arrives at a pool hall and is asked what he has inside his cue case, the cocky hustler replies with a grin: \"Doom.\"</li><li>The main Character has never actually been named in any Doom game, hence fans have referred to him as \" <a href=\"/doomguy/3005-842/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-842\">Doom Guy</a>\"</li><li>In every Doom game you play a lone space marine.</li><li>Doom set the precedent for the set guns FPS today have, such as Shotguns, Rocket Launchers, etc.</li><li>Many consider the term \"Fragged\" or \"Fragging\" to originate from Doom multiplayer.</li><li>DeathMatch was first made in Doom.</li><li>The main screenshot of Doom has the the main character holding a submachine gun, a weapon which is not in the final game.</li><li>Doomguy appears in <a href=\"/quake-iii-arena/3030-3874/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3874\">Quake III: Arena</a> under the alias \"Doom\", and in <a href=\"/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3/3030-5688/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5688\">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3</a> with bad air stats to indicate the original Doom did not have a jump button.</li><li>The Doom soundtrack took inspiration (to the point of replicating riffs and hooks) from a wide variety of Heavy Metal music in the first two games from bands such as: Pantera, Slayer, AC/DC, Judas Priest, and Metallica to name a few.</li><li>In <a href=\"/duke-nukem-3d/3030-3407/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3407\">Duke Nukem 3D</a>, the player can find the Doomguy near satanic imagery and clutching his throat (much like the death animation in the game) with Duke remarking \"that's one doomed space marine.\"</li><li>The final boss in <a href=\"/doom-ii-hell-on-earth/3030-621/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-621\">Doom II</a> the \"Icon of Sin\", has a opening in the head which is the only way to hurt the boss, when in fact your actually damaging <a href=\"/john-romero/3040-2/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-2\">John Romero</a>'s head on a pike, which can be seen with a no-clipping cheat.</li><li>In the Icon of Sin level in Doom 2, when you first encounter the main boss he will say a sentence that can't be understood, the reason is because it's a reversed speech.

All of these games are traditional beat-em-up games based on the gameplay of the first game, although they all expand on the features found in their predecessors. With gameplay features remain similar from game to game, the differences found within each game range from major changes in control, to minor enemy and weapon differences.</p><p>Naturally, one of Double Dragon's key aspects are the moves found in the game. Every game has granted the series' stars with a variety of unique moves, with the first game introducing the signature hair grab (where the player can grab an enemy's hair, and then proceed to either punch him repeatedly, or perform a throw). Double Dragon II and Double Dragon III both introduced a few moves, such as head butts, while Super Double Dragon altered the gameplay to be more ground focused, removing aerial attacks.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6150/503327-sddsnes6.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-503327\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.87109375\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.1%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6150/503327-sddsnes6.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-503327\"><img alt=\"Super Double Dragon\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/6150/503327-sddsnes6.gif\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/6150/503327-sddsnes6.gif 256w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Super Double Dragon\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/6150/503327-sddsnes6.gif\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/6150/503327-sddsnes6.gif 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Super Double Dragon</figcaption></figure><p>Double Dragon II: The Revenge significantly changed the way the game was played with the alteration of the game's control scheme. Opting for a <a href=\"/renegade/3030-18293/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18293\">Renegade</a> style directional based control scheme, Double Dragon II didn't require players to be facing a certain direction to attack. For example, if the player is facing right, one button will cause the player to punch forward, while the other will cause the character to perform a backwards kick.</p><p>Weapons are another large part of the series, with the first game introducing series staples such as the baseball bat, explosives, and even interactive rocks, boulders, or barrels. Every game has expanded the arsenal, although Double Dragon III: The Sacred Stones was criticized heavily for the weapons found in the arcade version. In Double Dragon III (the arcade version, and a few other versions), players would have to insert credits (i.e. actual money) in order to purchase new weapons, abilities, and characters from a shop mode.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6150/503502-dda7.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-503502\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\" data-width=\"240\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 240px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6150/503502-dda7.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-503502\"><img alt=\"Double Dragon Advance is one of the most well-received games in the franchise.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px\" data-width=\"240\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/6150/503502-dda7.gif\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/6150/503502-dda7.gif 240w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Double Dragon Advance is one of the most well-received games in the franchise.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/6150/503502-dda7.gif\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/6150/503502-dda7.gif 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px\" data-width=\"240\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Double Dragon Advance is one of the most well-received games in the franchise.</figcaption></figure><p>Each game in the series has had one particular change that either caused it to be hailed, or heavily criticized.

Based off of the Double Dragon cartoon, this game was an attempt to capitalize on the fighting game craze which began with the release of <a href=\"/street-fighter-ii/3030-243/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-243\">Street Fighter II</a>. A later Neo-Geo game from Technos, merely titled <a href=\"/double-dragon/3030-1752/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1752\">Double Dragon</a>, was better received than Double Dragon. This Neo-Geo game inspired <a href=\"/rage-of-the-dragons/3030-22629/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-22629\">Rage of the Dragons</a>, which was based off of the game (and featured two characters named Billy Lewis and Jimmy Lewis), although was not an official sequel.</p><p>Double Dragon V: The Shadow Falls was a traditional six-button fighting game. The game pits twelve fighters into one-on-one matches, although was criticized for a lack of innovative features. Other than a story mode based off of the cartoon, Double Dragon V introduced special attacks which could be triggered by holding one direction, and then quickly switching to another one while hitting the attack button. This was criticized, especially due to the general feel it created (as it is difficult to switch from one direction to another without hitting any in between).</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/29889/1316946-8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1316946\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/29889/1316946-8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1316946\"><img alt=\"Double Dragon was based off of the film.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-width=\"640\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/2/29889/1316946-8.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/2/29889/1316946-8.jpg 640w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/2/29889/1316946-8.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Double Dragon was based off of the film.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/2/29889/1316946-8.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/2/29889/1316946-8.jpg 640w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/2/29889/1316946-8.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-width=\"640\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Double Dragon was based off of the film.</figcaption></figure><p>The Neo-Geo game was much better received, partially due to the higher level of input from Technos Japan Corporation (Double Dragon V was almost entirely Tradewest's creation). Differing from Double Dragon V, this game doesn't have set buttons for punching or kicking, but rather four buttons that determine the power of the attack. As the fights progress, the player's charge meter is filled. When full, the player is able to unleash massive charged attacks on the enemy, which become more powerful the lower the player's health.</p><h3>Other Games</h3><p>A variety of other releases have been included in the Double Dragon franchise, most notably <a href=\"/battletoads-double-dragon-the-ultimate-team/3030-19366/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19366\">Battletoads &amp; Double Dragon: The Ultimate Team</a>.

The game is a traditional beat-em-up in which players are tasked with defeating the <a href=\"/dark-queen/3005-3937/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3937\">Dark Queen</a>, the final boss from <a href=\"/battletoads/3030-21228/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21228\">Battletoads</a>.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1341340-ddgg3.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1341340\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.9\" data-width=\"160\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 160px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:90.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1341340-ddgg3.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1341340\"><img alt=\"Double Dragon on the Game Gear centers around the murder of Jimmy Lee.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 160px) 100vw, 160px\" data-width=\"160\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/1341340-ddgg3.gif\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/1341340-ddgg3.gif 160w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Double Dragon on the Game Gear centers around the murder of Jimmy Lee.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/1341340-ddgg3.gif\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/1341340-ddgg3.gif 160w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 160px) 100vw, 160px\" data-width=\"160\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Double Dragon on the Game Gear centers around the murder of Jimmy Lee.</figcaption></figure><p>Many versions of Double Dragon have also been notable. The <a href=\"/game-gear/3045-5/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-5\">Game Gear</a> version of the first game was subtitled The Revenge of Billy Lee in Europe. While still retaining some similar gameplay elements, the Game Gear version focuses on Billy Lee's quest to avenge his brother Jimmy Lee, who has been murdered. This version of the game is considered by fans to be one of the worst games in the franchise.</p><p>The <a href=\"/game-boy/3045-3/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-3\">Game Boy</a> version of <a href=\"/double-dragon-ii/3030-5423/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5423\">Double Dragon II</a>: The Revenge is also particularly notable, due to the fact that it is merely a localized version of Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-Kun: Bangai Rantouhen, another beat-em-up from Technos Japan Corporation. In this version, Billy Lee is attempting to clear his name after being framed for a murder.</p><p>Many of the other ports of Double Dragon games have been relevant, particularly the ports to computer platforms. Typically handled by <a href=\"/binary-design-ltd/3010-496/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-496\">Binary Designs</a> or <a href=\"/virgin-mastertronic-ltd/3010-171/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-171\">Virgin Mastertronic</a>, these games are all considered to be of much lower quality than the main games. This is largely due to lowered graphical resolution (the <a href=\"/zx-spectrum/3045-16/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-16\">ZX Spectrum</a> version of Double Dragon had transparent sprites), sound quality (some <a href=\"/commodore-64/3045-14/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-14\">Commodore 64</a> versions completely removed the sound), or lack of key modes (most of the versions lacked two player cooperative).</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Comic Book</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1345295-comic5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1345295\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5749128919861\" data-width=\"574\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 574px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:157.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1345295-comic5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1345295\"><img alt=\"The fifth issue of the Double Dragon comic book.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px\" data-width=\"574\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/1345295-comic5.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/1345295-comic5.jpg 574w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The fifth issue of the Double Dragon comic book.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/1345295-comic5.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/1345295-comic5.jpg 574w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px\" data-width=\"574\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The fifth issue of the Double Dragon comic book.</figcaption></figure><p>A six issue comic book written by Dwayne McDuffie, Tom Breevoort, and Mike Kanterovich, the Double Dragon comic ran for six issues.

The comic books had very little involvement from Technos Japan Corporation, due to a licensing agreement with <a href=\"/tradewest-inc/3010-173/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-173\">Tradewest</a>. The comics portray the series' heroes in a different light, more as superheroes rather than martial artists. Additionally, the comic book introduced new supervillains, such as Superluminal, Exoskeleton, and Legerdemain.</p><h3>Television Show</h3><p>The cartoon based off of Double Dragon began on September 12, 1993. Created by DiC Entertainment, the series ran for 26 thirty-minute episodes for two seasons. The show follows Billy Lee and Jimmy Lee, although their story is altered from the games. In the show, they were separated after their birth. The pilot episode centers around their reunion. Jimmy is initially considered to be a villain due to the fact that he was raised by the brothers' mortal enemy, the <a href=\"/shadow-master/3005-14811/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14811\">Shadow Master</a>.</p><h3>Episodes</h3><ol><li>The Shadow Falls</li><li>The Legend Continues</li><li>The Price of Oblivion</li><li>River of Tears</li><li>Judgment Day</li><li>The Mistress of Chi</li><li>Over the Line</li><li>Rebirth</li><li>Call to Arms</li><li>Heart of the Matter</li><li>Dragon Hunt</li><li>The Eye of the Dragon</li><li>The Abyss</li><li>Shadow Khan</li><li>Shadow Claw</li><li>Doom Claw</li><li>Virtual Reality Bytes</li><li>Undertown</li><li>Superhighway Warriors</li><li>The Spirit in the Sword</li><li>RPM</li><li>Shadow Conned</li><li>The Sight of Freedom</li><li>The Ancients Arise</li><li>The Return of the Shadow Monster</li><li>Daj of Undertown</li></ol><h3>Film</h3><p>The film based on Double Dragon of the same name was released on November 4, 1994.

The series is based the second half of the original DragonBall serialized Japanese comic books in Shonen Jump magazine which takes a plot twist of being more sci-fi and action based mythology than the early magical adventure stories. In the years since its end, several attempts have been made to continue the story such as DragonBall GT in the 90's. Decades later a modern revival called DragonBall Super that ignores GT began airing due to the ceaseless demand for more DBZ content in the United States. There are three main villain sagas in core DBZ franchise and over ten movies with each with unique villains not seen in television show.</p><h2>Heroes</h2><h3>Goku</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/31/11011-golu_high.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-11011\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.28\" data-width=\"200\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:128.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/31/11011-golu_high.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-11011\"><img alt=\"Our Saiyan Hero\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/31/11011-golu_high.gif\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/31/11011-golu_high.gif 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\"></a><figcaption>Our Saiyan Hero</figcaption></figure><p>Son Goku is the main and most loved character in the Dragon Ball saga.

Piccolo also has the power to stretch his limbs in combat and regenerate from any wound or loss of body parts as long as his head has not been severely damaged. These abilities often distinguish him from the standard roster in video games.

Hercule managed to become the World Martial Arts Champion after the Z Fighters left the planet to fight overwhelmingly powerful extraterrestrials. As comic relief Mr. Satan is always trying to explain the Chi blasts and speed of the Z fighters as a fraudulent light show and taking credit for their victories. Mr. Satan plays a vital role in the destruction of Buu at the end of the story by convincing the people of Earth to lift their arms and give energy to Earth's true savor, Goku. The Spirit Bomb energy proved ataquite enough to fully disintegrate Buu's physical form and destroy his evil energy forever.</p><h3>Vegito</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/89473/2158820-vegitodbzep268.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2158820\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4\" data-width=\"500\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:140.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/89473/2158820-vegitodbzep268.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2158820\"><img alt=\"Vegito\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 457px) 100vw, 457px\" data-width=\"457\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/89473/2158820-vegitodbzep268.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/8/89473/2158820-vegitodbzep268.png 500w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/89473/2158820-vegitodbzep268.png 457w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Vegito\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/89473/2158820-vegitodbzep268.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/8/89473/2158820-vegitodbzep268.png 500w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/89473/2158820-vegitodbzep268.png 457w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 457px) 100vw, 457px\" data-width=\"457\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Vegito</figcaption></figure><p>Vegito is the <a href=\"/potara-earrings/3055-740/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-740\">Potara</a> fusion between Goku and Vegeta used to defeat Super Buu.

Vegito's personality is a mix of Vegeta's cockiness and Goku's cheerfulness, the result is an immensely powerful warrior that ends up toying with his enemies. Vegito is about the height of Goku but his hair resembles Vegeta's more than Goku's. Vegito is the most powerful being in DBZ brand, though for decades he was only ever shown in the standard Super Super Saiyan transformation during his brief appearance.

Goku easily rebounds the attacks back at Frieza killing him.</p><h3>Androids 19 and 20</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/89473/2158825-dr_gero_and_android_19_by_ghenny93.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2158825\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.1038696537678\" data-width=\"491\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 491px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:110.4%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/89473/2158825-dr_gero_and_android_19_by_ghenny93.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2158825\"><img alt=\"Androids 19 and 20\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 579px) 100vw, 579px\" data-width=\"579\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/8/89473/2158825-dr_gero_and_android_19_by_ghenny93.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/8/89473/2158825-dr_gero_and_android_19_by_ghenny93.jpg 491w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Androids 19 and 20\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/8/89473/2158825-dr_gero_and_android_19_by_ghenny93.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/8/89473/2158825-dr_gero_and_android_19_by_ghenny93.jpg 491w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 579px) 100vw, 579px\" data-width=\"579\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Androids 19 and 20</figcaption></figure><p>Android 19 is the last Android made by Dr. Gero (Android 20) and comes with him everywhere.

During this time, Gohan became able to transform into a Super Saiyan but Goku believed that although his current state still wouldn't be enough to defeat Cell, Gohan still had the potential to defeat him.</p><h3>Cell Saga</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/89473/2158835-cellgamesarena.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2158835\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/89473/2158835-cellgamesarena.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2158835\"><img alt=\"Cell's Arena\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/89473/2158835-cellgamesarena.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/8/89473/2158835-cellgamesarena.jpg 640w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/89473/2158835-cellgamesarena.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/89473/2158835-cellgamesarena.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Cell's Arena\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/89473/2158835-cellgamesarena.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/8/89473/2158835-cellgamesarena.jpg 640w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/89473/2158835-cellgamesarena.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/89473/2158835-cellgamesarena.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Cell's Arena</figcaption></figure><p>Shortly after the Androids arrive a large green insect monster called Cell appears. Cell is a very strong fighter who knows the moves and abilities of almost every Z-Fighter. Cell has a 4 stage life cycle. His Locust state, Imperfect Cell, Semi-Perfect Cell and Perfect Cell. Cell has to absorb people/androids in order to raise his power level and become the next stage higher. The Z-Fighters train heavily in order to stop Cell but their efforts seem to be in vain since Cell keeps coming back. Cell proposes the idea for a tournament called the Cell Games. Everyone trains extensively for this tournament besides Goku and Gohan because they believe Goku is already strong enough to beat Cell as it is. A massive battle ensues and many of the Z-Fighters perish but in the end Cell is destroyed and the Galaxy is saved once again.</p><h3>Great Saiyaman Saga</h3><p>After the Cell Saga Goku enters the Other World Tournament and finishes with a draw against the warrior Pikkon. Back on Earth Gohan is now attending high school at Orange Star High School. Gohan becomes a vigilante crime fighter under the name The Great Saiyaman. In order to keep is identity under wraps he wears a ridiculous costume. His classmate and future girlfriend, Videl, figures out his real identity and decides not to tell anyone under the one condition that Gohan teach her how to fly and enter the upcoming World Tournament. At the World Tournament the Z-Fighters easily make it to the main event matches. Here is the first scene of Yamu and Spopovich, two Majin fighters who are trying to get energy for Babidi to release Buu.</p><h3>Majin Buu Saga</h3><p>After Yamu and Spopovich steal Gohan's energy they retreat to a spaceship and give the energy to Babidi. The Z-Fighters are hot on their tail and when they arrive Dabura attacks them, hindering the Z-Fighter's efforts. Vegeta, Gohan, Supreme Kai, and Goku all enter the spaceship. There they find out they have to beat three fighters in order to reach Babidi, they uses rock-paper-scissors to determine who will fight. The Z-Fighters progress through the gauntlet easily but Vegeta's dark heart allows him to become a Majin warrior himself. Vegeta and Goku fight while Dabura takes on Gohan and Supreme Kai. Majin Buu ends up being released despite the Z-Warrior's best efforts. Buu regenerates tissue and is a very strong warrior. Vegeta fights Buu but cannot best him. Later on Goku powers up to Super Saiyan Three and has his way with Buu but cannot hold the transformation long enough to defeat him. Buu kills Babidi and makes an unlikely friend in Mr. Satan. Buu finds a puppy and names it Bee, all is looking well since Buu has given up killing until...two men show up and shoot Bee.</p><h3>Fusion Saga (Super Buu Saga)</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/89473/2158839-gotenks_03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2158839\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/89473/2158839-gotenks_03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2158839\"><img alt=\"Gotenks insulting Super Buu\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/89473/2158839-gotenks_03.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/8/89473/2158839-gotenks_03.jpg 640w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/89473/2158839-gotenks_03.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/89473/2158839-gotenks_03.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Gotenks insulting Super Buu\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/89473/2158839-gotenks_03.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/8/89473/2158839-gotenks_03.jpg 640w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/89473/2158839-gotenks_03.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/89473/2158839-gotenks_03.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Gotenks insulting Super Buu</figcaption></figure><p>Buu enraged by the killing of his dog blows out all of his rage in the form of steam. The rage forms into Evil Buu who kills the gunmen and then turns Buu into a piece of candy and eats him. Buu now becomes a less intelligent but extremely powerful Super Buu. Super Buu ravages Earth killing nearly everyone on the planet. At this time Piccolo teaches Goten and Trunks the Fusion Dance in order for them to fuse and become powerful enough to beat Super Buu. All while this is happening Gohan is on the Kai's world trying to unlock his true power. Super Buu flies to Kami's look out and challenges Gotenks to a fight. Gotenks goofs off the whole time instead of killing Buu right there so he gets away. Gohan comes back to Earth to fight Buu with his new powers but can't best him either. Super Buu absorbs Gohan and Gotenks. Goku comes back to Earth with special ear rings that allow two-people to fuse together for an unlimited amount of time. Goku uses these with Vegeta and they make Vegito. Vegito is controlling the fight with Super Buu until he gets turned into candy and eaten by Buu. Once inside of Buu Vegeta and Goku somehow defuse and go on a plan to free Gohan, Piccolo, Goten and Trunks. Once they free them Buu has a serious stomach ache and turns into his true form, Kid Buu.</p><h3>Kid Buu Saga</h3><p>Kid Buu's first act is destroying the Earth. Goku and Vegeta escape to the Other World only to be followed by Kid Buu. Goku and Vegeta are both bested by Kid Buu so Mr. Satan taunts Kid Buu, bringing out the Good Buu. Both Buu's fight and while this is happening Vegeta tells Dendai to go to Namek and wake the Dragon to wish for Earth to be back, he then tells them the plan to kill Kid Buu with a Spirit Bomb composed of all the energy of the people of Earth. Goku finishes the Spirit Bomb and fires it at Kid Buu. Goku does not have enough energy however to finish the attack. Dendai wishes for Goku's energy to be restored. Goku powers up to Super Saiyan and defeats Kid Buu, wishing that one day a good warrior as strong as Buu will be born, thus Uub is born. Goku also wishes that the people of Earth will forget about the whole Buu Saga so Good Buu can live on Earth freely.</p>", "guid": "3025-159", "name": "Dragon Ball Z"}, {"description": "<h2>Navigation</h2><p>Sub-franchises: <a data-ref-id=\"3025-1084\" href=\"/dragon-quest-monsters/3025-1084/\">Dragon Quest Monsters</a> | <a data-ref-id=\"3025-1104\" href=\"/dragon-quest-heroes/3025-1104/\">Dragon Quest Heroes</a></p><p>Related franchises: <a data-ref-id=\"3025-194\" href=\"/final-fantasy/3025-194/\">Final Fantasy</a> | <a data-ref-id=\"3025-1094\" href=\"/itadaki-street/3025-1094/\">Itadaki Street</a> | <a data-ref-id=\"3025-793\" href=\"/mystery-dungeon/3025-793/\">Mystery Dungeon</a></p><p>The series has become so popular in Japan, that a rumor has stated that the games were only released on weekends in Japan, because mid-week launches would see thousands of people calling in sick to go play it.</p><h2>Dragon Warrior</h2><p>For releases in the Dragon Quest franchise that were released in the US, they were required to be re-branded Dragon Warrior.

The first, which features hack and slash gameplay similar to the Dynasty Warriors franchise, is the main form of gameplay. As you fight waves of enemies, your character levels up and can gain multiple kinds of weapons with various magic abilities. These weapons also become stronger the more blood is spilled with them. As each game progresses, allies may join the party. In the first Drakengard, you can switch to a different ally for a limited time and summon their respective pact partners, which include a fairy, golem, and others. In Drakengard 2, you can switch to various party members on the fly and play as them for as long as you need, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, and their own sets of weapons (one character exclusively uses swords, another staves, then axes, and finally spears).</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1665/490602-drakengard_6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-490602\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.77176470588235\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:77.2%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1665/490602-drakengard_6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-490602\"><img alt=\" Flight combat during the hack-and-slash portion of the game.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px\" data-width=\"425\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/1665/490602-drakengard_6.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/1665/490602-drakengard_6.jpg 425w\"><noscript><img alt=\" Flight combat during the hack-and-slash portion of the game.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/1665/490602-drakengard_6.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/1665/490602-drakengard_6.jpg 425w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px\" data-width=\"425\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Flight combat during the hack-and-slash portion of the game.</figcaption></figure><p>The second part of gameplay features flight combat through the use of a dragon.

In the beginning of the game, the Empire forces begin an attack on their home. Caim goes to fight the soldiers to defend his sister. He cuts down many of the opposing army's soldiers, but suffers a near fatal blow to the back. As he fights his way into the courtyard, he finds an injured dragon the empire had captured. Remembering a dragon had killed his parents, Caim prepares to slay the beast, but knowing his life is almost at an end, he offers the dragon a choice. Die by his hand, or form a pact so they both can live. The dragon takes him up on his offer of a pact, and the two become pact partners. However, for a pact to take place between human and beast, the human must sacrifice something of theirs. Caim's sacrifice is his voice. The two fly together in order to destroy the Empire once and for all and to keep the seals of the world safe.</p><h3>Endings</h3><p>Drakengard features five different endings.</p><ul><li>Ending A: Furiae, the goddess and final seal keeping the world together, is killed. In order to save the world, Caim's dragon decides to become the seal in order to save the planet. She finally gives Caim her name, <a href=\"/angelus/3005-5816/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5816\"> Angelus</a>, and will be the only human to ever know her name. Caim takes the main antagonist, <a href=\"/manah/3005-10573/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-10573\"> Manah</a>, with him to show her the destruction she has caused so nothing like this can happen again. This is the canonical ending that sets up the events of Drakengard 2.</li><li>Ending B: Inuart, Furiae's betrothed, is driven insane by her death and resurrects her. When she revives, she is a beast that murders him. Caim defeats his former sister, and watches as clones of her bestial form descend to the planet, plummeting the world into chaos.</li><li>Ending C: Dragons are able to break free of their hold from the Watchers. Angelus regretfully turns against Caim and breaks their pact. Caim slays Angelus and watches as thousands of dragons begin to destroy the planet.</li><li>Ending D: Grotesqueries fall to the earth after Manah, who was under their control, is killed by her brother <a href=\"/seere/3005-13698/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-13698\"> Seere</a>, who cannot control his anger. The Grotesqueries devour anything and everything in their path, killing off most of the main party. Seere decides to go to the Grotesquerie Queen and seal that part of the world away forever.</li><li>Ending E: During the war with the Grotesqueries, a rift of space and time is opened, taking Caim, Angelus, and the Grotesquerie Queen to modern day Tokyo. Caim and Angelus are successful in slaying the Queen, saving the world, but are shot down by fighter jets soon after.

The game was initially announced in 1997, following the immense success of Duke Nukem 3D. It was planned to be a similar first-person shooter, and content has periodically leaked out over the past decade of development. The long development cycle can be blamed on a variety of factors. One interview with an anonymous 3D Realms employee stated the Duke Nukem creator <a data-ref-id=\"3040-1866\" href=\"/george-broussard/3040-1866/\" slug=\"george-broussard\">George Broussard</a> was constantly trying to improve the game, purchasing a variety of engines and adding a variety of concepts in order to make \"Forever\" an incredible game. This led to the team having to often start completely over when using a new engine, and the constant purchases nearly led the company bankruptcy.

It had a strong impact on the sci-fi genre, laying the foundations for the space opera sub-genre and inspiring popular franchises such as <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/star-trek/3025-330/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-330\">Star Trek</a> and <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/star-wars/3025-551/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-551\">Star Wars</a>.

For example, some of the characters in the first Dune game looks a lot like the actors in David Lynch's Dune film.</p><ul><li>Dune (1984)</li><li>Frank Herbert's Dune (2000) (TV)</li><li>Frank Herbert's Children of Dune (2003) (TV)</li></ul><h2>Planet Arrakis (Dune)</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The games are mainly played out on the planet <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/arrakis/3035-297/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-297\">Arrakis</a>, also known as Dune. Resembling the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/saudi-arabia/3035-1612/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1612\">Arabian Peninsula</a>, the planet is one big <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/desert/3035-1179/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1179\">desert</a> with little measurable surface water. It would be of no interest to anyone except it is the only source for the spice Melange. Because the Spice has properties that extend life, expand consciousness (especially important for safe navigation in the universe's faster-than-light travel), it has become the focal point of the politics in the Known Universe. Because of the Spice, then, anyone who wants absolute power must control Arrakis.</p><blockquote><i>\"He who controls the spice, controls the universe!\"</i> <br />- Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, Dune (the movie)</blockquote><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Arrakis is mainly inhabited by the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/fremen/3015-2308/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2308\">Fremen</a> people, who <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/paul-atreides/3005-7580/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-7580\">Paul Atreides</a>, also known as <a href=\"http://dune.wikia.com/wiki/Muad%27Dib_(Paul_Atreides)\" rel=\"nofollow \" data-ref-id=\"false\">Muad'Dib</a>, leads as their <a href=\"http://dune.wikia.com/wiki/Mahdi\" rel=\"nofollow \" data-ref-id=\"false\">Mahdi</a> (Messiah) in a rebellion against their brutal <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/house-harkonnen/3015-5407/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5407\">Harkonnen</a> rulers and eventually against the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/house-corrino/3015-5413/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5413\">Corrino</a> dynasty of the <a href=\"http://dune.wikia.com/wiki/Galactic_Padishah_Empire\" rel=\"nofollow \" data-ref-id=\"false\">Galactic Padishah Empire</a>.</p><h2>Recurring themes</h2><h3>Spice harvesting</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Because of its high value, harvested Spice is often used in games to finance the player's war efforts, or in the case of the first game, both buy equipment and placate the Emperor.</p><h3>Atreides vs Harkonnen</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Because the great majority of Frank Herbert's Dune fiction revolves around characters connected to the House Atreides, it would not be a Dune game if the Atreides were not in it. And where you have the Atreides, you will have their arch-enemy, the House Harkonnen.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">So even if the game doesn't follow any of the stories in the books, it will still pit the Atreides and the Harkonnens against each other.</p><h3>Analog Machines</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">While a minor touch for the purposes of game play, there are no computers known in the Dune Universe, having been forbidden after the Butlerian Jihad, a war by humanity to wrest free from the weakness of mind and soul that they said came from dependence upon so-called thinking machines, or computers. In the place of computers are \"human computers,\" Mentats, who share some of the heightened processing power of the banned devices, and machines that must be controlled manually or with simple automation mechanisms. Nothing is computer controlled.</p><h3>Arrakis</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">This may go without saying, but all of the Dune games usually take place exclusively on Arrakis, as the titular planet of the series. The books and movies themselves took place on many different worlds, but the gameplay of games from the franchise seem to take place exclusively on the planet itself. There are cutscenes from the home planets of other worlds, however and <a href=\"/emperor-battle-for-dune/3030-19932/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19932\">Emperor: Battle for Dune</a> featured a few missions set on the factions' home planets.</p><h2>Major Breaks with the Novels</h2><figure style=\"width: 196px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/913/1064972-ordosmentat_big.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1064972\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.25\" data-width=\"196\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:125.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/913/1064972-ordosmentat_big.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1064972\"><img alt=\"Mentat of House Ordos, eyebrows and lips fairly tame by the usual Mentat standards\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/913/1064972-ordosmentat_big.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/913/1064972-ordosmentat_big.jpg 196w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 196px) 100vw, 196px\" data-width=\"196\"></a><figcaption>Mentat of House Ordos, eyebrows and lips fairly tame by the usual Mentat standards</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">One popular House in the Dune games is House Ordos, the masters of spycraft and deception. Except for a cusory mention in the non-canon Dune Encyclopedia (1984), House Ordos is never mentioned in any of the Dune literature. Ordos helps round out the selection of Houses, and prevents the games from being too firmly entrenched in the Harkonnen vs. Atreides pattern.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">There is a slew of new equipment created just for the games, although even from a canon standpoint this can only serve to help flesh out the Dune universe through what was most often a Real Time Strategy context. It seems that the battles on the surface of the planet were decided largely through strategic elements in the book, while tactics, resource management, and attrition figure strongest into the games.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In many of the later games, major roles are taken by characters resembling their counterparts in the books, including a Harkonnen leader with a penchant for treachery and pulling people's heart plugs, an honorable Atreides ruler, and a devious Emperor. They are given different names, and their roles in the story, though similar to those in the books, are there to keep the games' stories moving.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Of course the greatest break from the novels is the very idea that different factions can win. The nature of games allows for the house the player controls to be victorious. In later games the cutscenes depicting victory in battle and in the entire conflict became increasingly elaborate, often resembling the design sense of David Lynch's version of the story.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The first Dune game even sets about recreating the basic story of Dune, especially if one follows the first film, but it tastefully breaks with many of the events, even switching the capital cities that the Harkonnen and Atredeis houses occupied, as well as changing the fates of many of the minor and major characters.</p>", "guid": "3025-166", "name": "Dune"}, {"description": "<h2 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Overview</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Dungeons &amp; Dragons is an award winning, genre spanning series of table-top role playing games, initially developed in 1974 by <a href=\"/e-gary-gygax/3040-25447/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-25447\">Gary Gygax</a> and <a href=\"/dave-arneson/3040-25448/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-25448\">Dave Arneson</a>.

There is an attack button, secondary attack button and a \"musou\" button. Each general can choose from an assortment of different combos, but these combos stay the same per character. For instance, for the PS2 versions \"Square, Square, Triangle\" is a combo for every single character. There are no combos that require the player to press the D-Pad or analog stick in any direction, and rely entirely on mixing up the attack, and secondary attack buttons. The longest combo is six buttons (Attack, Attack, Attack, Attack, Atack, Secondary Attack). A Musou attack can be activated if the Musou meter is filled. The Musou meter is filled by attacking and killing enemy troops or generals, taking damage fills the bar also and when the players health bar goes below a certain threshold the bar rapidly fills continuously for essentially endless Musou attacks at the risk of dying from a hit, alternatively the player can pick up a Musou boost item which may drop from enemies or can be found inside breakable items on the battle field. When intiated, the player is invincible for the duration of the attack, and deals massive damage to any units near by, making it very lethal. Enemy generals may also use Musou attacks, but general infantry may not.</p><h2>Strategy</h2><p>The Dynasty Warriors Franchise is a series of games with beat 'em up style game play. With each installment only make minuscule updates to the franchise's formula. Usually the player picks (or is forced to play as) a general from one of the Kingdoms: Wu, Wei, Shu, or Other. After that they are placed in a battlefield and are given the task of eliminating the enemy general. How the player accomplishes this depends on the situation. Typically the player must advance with their army across the map taking over stronghold points. These strongholds are overcome in different ways depending on which version of the game is played. In Dynasty Warriors 4 the player must neutralize five \"gate keepers\" before the stronghold turns to the player's side. However in Dynasty Warriors 5 the player must kill a \"gate keeper\" that unlocks the gate to an outdoor fort, and then kill four gate keepers. Steadily capturing strongholds allows the player's army to advance, and assist in the attack on the enemy general, but in reality the player can just run past all enemy troops and go right for the general, without much trouble.</p><h2>Kingdoms</h2><p>Every Dynasty Warrior game focuses around the Romance of the Three Kingdoms novels written by Luo Guanzhong. Each Kingdom is striving to rule over China, using military might to decipher which kingdom is fit to rule. In addition to these Three kingdoms, there are a variety of 3rd parties that also try to rule over the land. In the end of this tale (which is based on historic events) none of the kingdoms shown in the games rule over China, and are all eventually defeated by another Kingdom that rises up. The stories of these Kingdoms often intertwine with each other, including many advance and complicated subplots and storylines throughout the novel version of the story. The games never fully explain these stories successfully, often confusing anyone who plays the games.</p><h3>Shu</h3><p>Historically found at around 220 CE, the kingdom of Shu lies in the southwestern portion of China that also included Nanzhong (which is why Shu forces had campaigns against Meng Huo and company). Liu Bei is Shu's king and leader. He believes that ruling has to be just in order to keep the peace throughout the land, which is why he is incredibly popular among the lower classes. When Liu Bei passes away, his son Liu Chan takes over and rules for a much longer period until the historical fall of the Shu Kingdom in 264. Like his father, Chan is a man of justice but is much less competent.</p><p>Keeping Shu in working order is the Prime Minister Kong Ming, otherwise known in the game as Zhuge Liang. Often credited to be the most intelligent military genius of his era, Zhuge Liang is also a mastermind of domestic affairs. It is he who ensures that the kingdom and its business function normally. Zhuge Liang is married to Yue Ying, another playable character in some Dynasty Warriors game, and is also a smart person in her own right.</p><p>The list of generals who fought for Shu typically included warriors who served Liu Bei well before Shu was established and their offspring. The most notable fighters among them are those included in the \"5 Tiger Generals of Shu\": Zhao Yun, Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Ma Chao and Huang Zhong. Zhao Yun is typically the cover boy of the Dynasty Warriors games, a fearless warrior who would often charge against armies many times his numbers and still win. Guan Yu is a sworn brother to Liu Bei, famous today for his long, beautiful beard, imposing stature and skills as a warrior. Zhang Fei is yet another sworn brother to Liu Bei and Guan Yu. His fighting skills are as impressive as any warrior of his era, but his penchant for drinking and hotheadedness sinks his reputation. Ma Chao was a more recent addition to the Shu army, but has shown considerable promise when fighting for his father Ma Teng and against Cao Cao before 220. Huang Zhong is the old man among the group, a proven veteran and a master with the bow and arrow. Wei Yan is also considered to be at par with the 5 Tigers, but his personality detracted much of the praise he could've gained.</p><p>The second wave of Shu generals usually were offsprings or relatives of the aforementioned warriors. Guan Yu had three sons: Guan Ping, Guan Xing and Guan Suo who all served in battle (although only 2 are playable). Xing Cai is Zhang Fei's daughter, a warrior herself, and is Liu Chan's consort. Ma Dai is the younger cousin of Ma Chao. Jiang Wei becomes the de-facto administrator after Zhuge Liang, capable of pulling off military campaigns and taking care of domestic affairs with ease.</p><h3>Wu</h3><p>The Wu Kingdom is headed by the Sun family. Originally headed by Sun Jian, the leaders of the Wu often fall victim to ill-fate. Sun Jian, and other Wu notable Huang Gai ran the Wu kingdom for a number of years, before Sun Jian passed reign over to his eldest son Sun Ce. Sun Ce, and his best friend and sworn brother, and strategist Zhou Yu (not be confused with Shu's Zhao Yun) successfully increased the Wu's influence over China, but this reign did not last long. Sun Ce fell victim to an illness, and died at the age of 25 or 26 circa 200 AD. Sun Quan, the next eldest son took over ruling Wu, but continued to use Zhou Yu's strategies in the years to come. Sun Shang Xiang, sister of Sun Ce and Sun Quan, was loyal to the Wu kingdom for a number of years. One day she met Shu leader Liu Bei and fell in love with him instantly. One of the many stories that are lost in the game adaptations, Sun Shang Xiang was cast out from Wu for her love affair with Liu Bei although as with many previous omissions this was added to the story of Dynasty Warriors 7.</p><h3>Wei</h3><p>Headed by the mighty Cao Cao and later by Cao Pi (second eldest son, the oldest, Cao Ang, died in battle in 198 AD), the Wei are often depicted as the \"villains\" of the story, due to their ambitious leader Cao Cao, who basks in the chaos that controls the land. Cao Cao is the most prominent leader of the three, attending, and often leading most of the historic battles that took place (as opposed to the often changing Wu rotation, and Shu which switches off between a number of important five generals). Cao Cao often looks to his strategist Sima Yi for strategic assitance. Sima Yi, who would later create his own faction known as Jin, has an obession with Shu's strategist Zhuge Liang, often challenging him, but never succeeding. The Wei Kingdom has a strong collection of powerful generals. These include Xiahou Dun (Cao Cao's cousin) a vicious warrior who ate his own eyeball after it was shot by an arrow. Zhang Liao, formerly Lu Bu's right hand man and a repsect opponent of Guan Yu, and Dian Wei and Xu Zhu, bodyguards of Cao Cao.</p><h3>Jin</h3><p>The Jin was a branch of Wei created by Sima Yi, who believed that he and his family can take over the land for his own. As a result, many of the Jin's generals came from the Wei talent pool. The primary cast of this faction include the Sima family (Yi, Sima Zhao, Sima Shi), Sima Shi's wife, Wang Yuan Ji. Historically, it is this faction that defeated all the others to begin the next phase of Chinese history: The Jin Dynasty.</p><p><b>Other</b></p><p>Other notables include Yuan Shao, a descendant of a powerful family who was influential during the early periods before the rise of the Three Kingdoms. Yuan Shao fought during the Yellow Turban Rebellion and was a primary commander for the coalition against Dong Zhuo, but his ultimate downfall was against Cao Cao in the Battle of Guan Du.</p><p>Dong Zhuo was another key character. He fought in the Yellow Turban Rebellion before taking the capital for his own. His is characterized as a lazy, greedy hedonist who wants nothing but wine and women. One of Dong Zhou's notable followers and most popular franchise characters is Lu Bu, often depicted as \"the greatest warrior that ever lived.\" Lu Bu was as capable of wielding his infamous halberd as he is performing the martial arts and using the bow and arrow (the latter two are not explicit). Factor in his Red Hare, the fastest horses in China, and he is a force to be reckoned with. Despite these attributes, Lu Bu is cruel and impulsive, often jumping into the fray without thought. Often in games, Lu Bu is so overpowered that he can kill players with little effort, and as a result players tend to stay away from him until characters grow to enough strength.</p><p>However, even Lu Bu's heart melts before Diao Chan, another important character without any kingdom affiliation. Considered to be one of the four \"Legendary Beauties\" in China, Diao Chan was assigned to tear the relationship between Lu Bu and Dong Zhuo apart, which she succeeds in doing. After Dong Zhuo's death, she travels with Lu Bu and aids him in his conquest. Despite capable of wielding various weapons (maces, whips from DW 2-6), she is more pacifistic than her contemporaries.</p><p>Other main characters include Meng Huo, the king of Nan Man who fought against Shu momentarily, Zhu Rong, his wife who also joins into the fighting.</p><p>Zhang Jiao was the leader of the Yellow Turban Rebellion that showcased the likes of Liu Bei, Cao Cao and Sun Jian, and set the course for the events proceeding to the Three Kingdoms Era. He's also a playable character in some of the games.</p>", "guid": "3025-169", "name": "Dynasty Warriors"}, {"description": "<h2>Overview</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/429/181274-mother_boxart.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-181274\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.6838905775076\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:68.4%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/429/181274-mother_boxart.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-181274\"><img alt=\"The official Japanese box art for Mother\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/429/181274-mother_boxart.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/429/181274-mother_boxart.png 329w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/429/181274-mother_boxart.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>The official Japanese box art for Mother</figcaption></figure><p>EarthBound is a series of <a data-ref-id=\"3015-192\" href=\"/turn-based/3015-192/\" slug=\"turn-based\">turn-based</a> role-playing games. The series is created by <a data-ref-id=\"3040-40611\" href=\"/shigesato-itoi/3040-40611/\" slug=\"shigesato-itoi\">Shigesato Itoi</a> for <a data-ref-id=\"3010-90\" href=\"/nintendo-co-ltd/3010-90/\" slug=\"nintendo-co-ltd\">Nintendo</a>. It began in 1989 with the release of a Japan-only Famicom (the Japanese version of the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-21\" href=\"/nes/3045-21/\" slug=\"nes\">Nintendo Entertainment System</a>) game called <a data-ref-id=\"3030-11753\" href=\"/mother/3030-11753/\" slug=\"mother\">Mother</a>. A sequel was released in 1995 titled <a data-ref-id=\"3030-8307\" href=\"/earthbound/3030-8307/\" slug=\"earthbound\">EarthBound</a> (Mother 2 in Japan) for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. In 2003, a port of the first two games was released in Japan titled <a data-ref-id=\"3030-3775\" href=\"/mother-12/3030-3775/\" slug=\"mother-12\">Mother 1 + 2</a>. The last game in the franchise (according to Shigesato itoi) titled <a data-ref-id=\"3030-3864\" href=\"/mother-3/3030-3864/\" slug=\"mother-3\">Mother 3</a> was released in Japan in 2006 for the Game Boy Advance. Shigesato Itoi stated in an interview that the name of the franchise, Mother, derived from the John Lennon song Mother (The Beatles, and other American pop culture are a common theme in the Super Nintendo game).</p><p>The games are all \"stand-alone\" (meaning they don't have to be played in order to be understood) as opposed to following a single group of heroes, the games share common themes, characters, and setting. The trilogy is connected through their final bosses.</p><p>This series differed from other RPGs in many key ways. When Mother was first released, most RPGs featured knights, wizards, and other such medieval things. The franchise is more of a modern American setting. The enemies are unique to the franchise, from giant piles of barf to <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3562\" href=\"/hippies/3015-3562/\" slug=\"hippies\">hippies</a>. The weapons are also unique, normally some sort of household item (for example, yo-yos, <a data-ref-id=\"3055-39\" href=\"/baseball-bat/3055-39/\" slug=\"baseball-bat\">baseball bats</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3055-508\" href=\"/frying-pan/3055-508/\" slug=\"frying-pan\">frying pans</a>).</p><p>The series is well-known for its devoted and extremely loyal fanbase. Since the release of Mother, the franchise has had this following among both American and Japanese gamers. Despite the Japan-only releases of Mother and Mother 3, a translated cartridge of Mother was uncovered and dumped for gamers to play. Mother 3 was also translated, and is available in English (as well as being translated into other languages). Both of these were fan projects originating from the franchise's central American fan website, Starmen.net.</p><p>EarthBound has also appeared in Nintendo's <a data-ref-id=\"3025-318\" href=\"/super-smash-bros/3025-318/\" slug=\"super-smash-bros\">Super Smash Bros.</a> franchise. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-789\" href=\"/ness/3005-789/\" slug=\"ness\">Ness</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1137\" href=\"/lucas/3005-1137/\" slug=\"lucas\">Lucas</a> are playable characters in the franchise. <a data-ref-id=\"3035-224\" href=\"/onett/3035-224/\" slug=\"onett\">Onett</a>, Eagleland, <a data-ref-id=\"3035-937\" href=\"/fourside/3035-937/\" slug=\"fourside\">Fourside</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1723\" href=\"/new-pork-city/3035-1723/\" slug=\"new-pork-city\">New Pork City</a> (locales from the franchise) have also appeared as stages in the game.

As evidenced by the humorous names, Earthworm Jim is rife with ridiculous humor, such as cow launching, killer goldfish, pointlessly long item names (e.g. Ultra-high-tech-indestructible-super-space-cyber-suit), and colorful graphics meant to accentuate the humor.<br/><br/>Earthworm Jim is an action platformer. The player controls Earthworm Jim, who has three main actions. He can jump, attack with his head (whipping himself out of the suit to hit nearby enemies), or shoot his gun. Shooting the gun requires ammunition, which can be collected through items commonly found throughout the levels. Whipping Jim's head can also be used for other things, such as whipping across pits.

The game was also based off of the TV show, which caused confusion as the show had been off the air since 1996. The constant shifts in development during the game's development cycle caused many issues, including several cut characters and a poor frame rate.<br/><br/>The game involves the collection of several \"Golden Udders,\" which are said to help cure Earthworm Jim of his insanity (after being hit by a flying cow). The game is primarily a platformer, as players control Jim and traverse a variety of levels. In addition to the platforming and exploration aspects, players can use Jim's blaster to fight enemies. Despite the game's attempt at expansion, its rushed development cycle led to many criticisms and a variety of cuts.<br/><br/><h3>Earthworm Jim: Menace 2 the Galaxy   </h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/1190949-ej007.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1190949\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.9\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:90.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/1190949-ej007.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1190949\"><img alt=\"\u00a0Menace 2 the Galaxy \" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17172/1190949-ej007.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17172/1190949-ej007.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"\u00a0Menace 2 the Galaxy \" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17172/1190949-ej007.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17172/1190949-ej007.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0Menace 2 the Galaxy </figcaption></figure> <br/>After the ill-fated third game, the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-57\" href=\"/game-boy-color/3045-57/\" slug=\"game-boy-color\">      Game Boy Color</a> exclusive <a data-ref-id=\"3030-7846\" href=\"/earthworm-jim-menace-2-the-galaxy/3030-7846/\" slug=\"earthworm-jim-menace-2-the-galaxy\">     Earthworm Jim: Menace 2 the Galaxy</a> was released. The game is an action platformer akin to the first two games, although there are many differences. Menace 2 the Galaxy is much more non-linear to than the original games, and the game does not have the same colorful cartoon-style look. Additionally, the game is more of a straight action platformer, rather than focusing on a variety of bizarre aspects (like the first and second games).<br/><br/><h2>Television Show</h2>\u00a0The television show based off of Earthworm Jim ran for two seasons (23 episodes). The show was broadcasted on Kids' WB, and was on the air from 1995 to 1996. The show retains the ridiculous and bizarre humor from the games, with a variety of original inventions introduced in the show. In addition, Earthworm Jim introduces a sidekick for Jim, Peter Puppy, who is much more level-headed than the main protagonist. Most of the episodes focus on Jim and Peter Puppy rescuing Princess What's-Her-Name from the variety of villains introduced in the game, including <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2355\"

In 1991, <a href=\"/the-amazing-spider-man-vs-the-kingpin/3030-20388/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20388\">The Amazing Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin</a> was released for the Sega Master System, and later released for the <a href=\"/genesis/3045-6/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-6\">Genesis</a>, Game Gear, and <a href=\"/sega-cd/3045-29/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-29\">Sega CD</a>. This game followed Spider-Man after being framed by the <a href=\"/kingpin/3005-4889/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4889\">Kingpin</a> for planting a bomb in the city of New York.</p><p>During the 16-bit era, Spider-Man games were released almost yearly, with several games based on actual comic book stories. Most notable of these are <a href=\"/spider-man-venom-maximum-carnage/3030-20034/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20034\">Spider-Man &amp; Venom: Maximum Carnage</a> and <a href=\"/spider-man-venom-separation-anxiety/3030-4181/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4181\">Spider-Man &amp; Venom: Separation Anxiety</a>. These games were both very anticipated and very well-received (critically and commercially). They are beat-em-up action games, starring either Spider-Man or <a href=\"/venom/3005-932/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-932\">Venom</a> in the comic book stories on which they are based. In addition, Spider-Man: Lethal Foes was released only in Japan for the Super Famicom, based off of the Spider-Man miniseries titled \"Lethal Foes of Spider-Man.\" <a href=\"/spider-man-and-the-x-men-arcades-revenge/3030-10085/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10085\">Spider-Man and the X-Men: Arcade's Revenge</a> was another well-received game released on the <a href=\"/snes/3045-9/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\">SNES</a> and Genesis, although it was much more loosely based in the comic books than aforementioned games.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6508/201877-venom_desperation_move.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-201877\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"512\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 512px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6508/201877-venom_desperation_move.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-201877\"><img alt=\"Venom performing his desperation move.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/6508/201877-venom_desperation_move.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/6508/201877-venom_desperation_move.jpg 512w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/6508/201877-venom_desperation_move.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/6508/201877-venom_desperation_move.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Venom performing his desperation move.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/6508/201877-venom_desperation_move.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/6508/201877-venom_desperation_move.jpg 512w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/6508/201877-venom_desperation_move.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/6508/201877-venom_desperation_move.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Venom performing his desperation move.</figcaption></figure><p>The animated series and later movies have spawned numerous video game adaptations. <a href=\"/spider-man-the-animated-series/3030-2926/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2926\">Spider-Man: The Animated Series</a> was the first, released in 1993 for the SNES and Genesis.

The game plays primarily from a top-down perspective, where players control Frank Castle as he investigates his family's murder. At some points, the game shifts to a first-person perspective, particularly when fighting enemies. In addition, there is a driving mode (known as the \"Battle Van\") and side-scrolling underwater parts of the game.</p><p>Arguably the most well-received game in the Punisher franchise, a third game by the name of merely <a href=\"/the-punisher/3030-22163/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-22163\">The Punisher</a> was released in 1993 for the arcade platform by Capcom. The Punisher is a beat-em-up, naturally starring Frank Castle (however, the game does offer <a href=\"/nick-fury/3005-4905/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4905\">Nick Fury</a> as a playable character as well). Following the same formula of Capcom's many beat-em-ups, The Punisher does differ in many aspects (especially the ability to use weaponry such as an M16 or a flamethrower). The game was ported to the Sega Genesis in 1994, with minor changes such as graphics and censorship.</p><p>In 2005, a fourth game titled <a href=\"/the-punisher/3030-2242/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2242\">The Punisher</a> was released, based off of the 2004 film of the same name. A third-person action game (with shooting and stealth elements), The Punisher was designed to be a violent action game. This is evidenced in scenes where the Punisher can violently torture his enemies, attempting to force them to reveal information about the Jigsaw (the Punisher's biggest threat in the game).</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4865/882048-504x_custom_1233870551422_pun5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-882048\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.56349206349206\" data-width=\"504\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 504px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4865/882048-504x_custom_1233870551422_pun5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-882048\"><img alt=\"The Punisher: No Mercy\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4865/882048-504x_custom_1233870551422_pun5.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/4865/882048-504x_custom_1233870551422_pun5.jpg 504w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4865/882048-504x_custom_1233870551422_pun5.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4865/882048-504x_custom_1233870551422_pun5.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Punisher: No Mercy\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4865/882048-504x_custom_1233870551422_pun5.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/4865/882048-504x_custom_1233870551422_pun5.jpg 504w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4865/882048-504x_custom_1233870551422_pun5.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4865/882048-504x_custom_1233870551422_pun5.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Punisher: No Mercy</figcaption></figure><p>The first game in the franchise (not counting the ported Game Boy game) to not simply be titled \"The Punisher\" was released in 2009 for the <a href=\"/playstation-network-ps3/3045-88/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-88\">PlayStation Network</a>.

Along the way, players fight numerous supervillains, including <a href=\"/modok/3005-9897/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9897\">M.O.D.O.K.</a>, <a href=\"/mysterio/3005-6103/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-6103\">Mysterio</a>, Dr. Doom, Mephisto, Mandarin, Kraken, <a href=\"/loki/3005-1993/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1993\">Loki</a>, Arcade, Rhino, <a href=\"/blackheart/3005-1977/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1977\">Blackheart</a>, and many, many others.

At the time, <a href=\"/bethesda-softworks/3010-786/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-786\">Bethesda Softworks</a> was mainly a sports game studio and as a result they were laughed at when the idea for an action-RPG game came up. Despite the mockery, Bethesda went on to create one of the most beloved <a href=\"/games/?sort=release_date&amp;filter_type=genre&amp;filter_value=5/\">RPG</a> series around that redefined <a href=\"/open-world/3015-207/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-207\">open-world</a> gameplay and player choice.</p><h2>Recurring Elements</h2><p>The Elder Scrolls places a large emphasis on player customization, freedom, and the ability to do almost anything you want and be whoever you want. The games start with the player creating their character, and from there the world opens up to them with nearly endless possibilities. This is one of the reasons why the series has received praise from critics. Although certain elements like combat and the level progression have been criticized in the past, credit is always given to the studio for giving the player lots of freedom.</p><p>Bethesda has shown an appreciation for detail in their games in the past, and a common theme is that each games starts out with the player either escaping or being released from prison.</p><h2><a href=\"/the-elder-scrolls-arena/3030-7513/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7513\">The Elder Scrolls: Arena</a></h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15693/630354-564545_53892_front_1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-630354\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.2671875\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:126.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15693/630354-564545_53892_front_1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-630354\"><img alt=\"The Elder Scrolls: Arena\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/15693/630354-564545_53892_front_1_.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/15693/630354-564545_53892_front_1_.jpg 640w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/15693/630354-564545_53892_front_1_.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/15693/630354-564545_53892_front_1_.jpg 505w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 505px) 100vw, 505px\" data-width=\"505\"></a><figcaption>The Elder Scrolls: Arena</figcaption></figure><ul><li><b>Release Date:</b> March 1994</li><li><b>Platform:</b> <a href=\"/pc/3045-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a></li></ul><p>Originally, Arena was meant to be a tournament fighting game in which the player and a team would travel from arena to arena battling other teams to eventually become the grand champion. In addition to the arenas were side-quests that could be completed along the way. During development however, <a href=\"/side-quests/3015-338/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-338\">side-quests</a> started to become more and more important than the actual arena fighting, and eventually RPG elements were added in as well as cities and <a href=\"/dungeon/3035-1131/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1131\">dungeons</a>. The team decided to drop the tournament fighting in favor of creating a large singleplayer first-person RPG.</p><p>The game was meant to be released around Christmas of 1993, but Bethesda missed the deadline and as a result had to wait till earlier the next year to put the game out. The game became a cult hit despite negative reviews and poor sales (partially due to the misleading title). The game was free for download from the Bethesda website.</p><p>It's worth noting that the game is not like the games that came after, in that you are unable to create a custom class, and experience is gained through completing quests and killing monsters, rather than practicing skills. You are also able to travel throughout <a href=\"/tamriel/3035-92/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-92\">Tamriel</a> instead of being restricted to specific provinces, although the countryside surrounding city or town is randomly generated and never links up with the other areas.

The game was to be called Mournhold and set in <a href=\"/morrowind/3035-514/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-514\">Morrowind</a>, but the team soon changed the location to the provinces of <a href=\"/high-rock/3035-682/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-682\">High Rock</a> and <a href=\"/hammerfell/3035-683/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-683\">Hammerfell</a>. A few big changes were made for the game, including the omission of experience points for a system that revolved around skills. Daggerfall also gave players the ability to create their own class rather than choosing from a pre-set list and the ability to assign their own skills as well.</p><p>Daggerfall has one of the largest game worlds ever created. There are 15,000 towns, dungeons, cities, and villages for the player the explore and over 750,000 NPCs the player can interact with.

The skills chosen for primary or major skills are the ones that influence the gathering of experience, now a hallmark for the series.

This meant that the team would be developing the game for next gen consoles that didn't even exist yet. In fact, the team didn't get final hardware until the last six months or so of development.</p><p>After Morrowind's release, the team was split into two groups: artists/designers, and programmers. The former group was sent to work on expansions for Morrowind, while the latter began developing the technology that would be used for Oblivion. According to Bethesda, the Xbox 360 version was the easiest to develop because the PC was more like a \"random amalgamation of graphic cards and RAM and processors\" and that it was poorly \"defined\". Their lack of experience with the <a href=\"/playstation/3045-22/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-22\">PlayStation</a> also meant that the programmers who had worked with the Playstation in the past went to work with that system specifically.</p><p>In the year 2005, Bethesda entered into an agreement with <a href=\"/take-two-interactive-software-inc/3010-450/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-450\">Take-Two Interactive</a> that proved to be a very successful relationship. In the agreement, Bethesda was allowed to retain complete and total control over the development of Oblivion and any future games and Take-Two agreed to publish the game under the <a href=\"/2k-games/3010-360/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-360\">2K Games</a> brand. The good relationship was considered a rarity in the industry. Take-Two had minimal interference with the development of the game and mostly left Bethesda alone.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6162/1225296-oblivion_2009_12_14_17_30_26_26.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1225296\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"1440\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1440px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6162/1225296-oblivion_2009_12_14_17_30_26_26.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1225296\"><img alt=\"A forest in Oblivion\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/6162/1225296-oblivion_2009_12_14_17_30_26_26.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/6162/1225296-oblivion_2009_12_14_17_30_26_26.jpg 1440w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/0/6162/1225296-oblivion_2009_12_14_17_30_26_26.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/6162/1225296-oblivion_2009_12_14_17_30_26_26.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/6162/1225296-oblivion_2009_12_14_17_30_26_26.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A forest in Oblivion\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/6162/1225296-oblivion_2009_12_14_17_30_26_26.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/6162/1225296-oblivion_2009_12_14_17_30_26_26.jpg 1440w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/0/6162/1225296-oblivion_2009_12_14_17_30_26_26.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/6162/1225296-oblivion_2009_12_14_17_30_26_26.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/6162/1225296-oblivion_2009_12_14_17_30_26_26.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A forest in Oblivion</figcaption></figure><p>Bethesda focused on making Oblivion with a combination of freedom and cutting-edge visuals. Unlike Morrowind, every line of dialog is spoken. Graphical improvements include the use of <a href=\"/high-dynamic-range/3015-618/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-618\">high dynamic range</a> and enhanced textures. Bethesda also used <a href=\"/havok-physics/3015-502/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-502\">Havok</a> for the physics. In order to make the NPCs in the game seem dynamic and more life-like, Bethesda developed the Radiant AI system that allowed NPCs to have daily schedules, move about the city, and have conversations with other NPCs. To create the beautiful forests seen in the game, the team used <a href=\"/speedtree/3015-1684/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1684\">SpeedTree</a> which gave them the ability to generate complex forests with relative ease. Some of the major goals for the game included the omission of pointless filler quests and the development of more fleshed out characters with actual personalities. Because of this, the number of NPCs in the game had to be reduced. As a result, the characters in the game no longer feel like mindless drones. Improvements to the combat made it so that hits were no longer determined by \"dice rolls\".</p><p>Like other Elder Scrolls games, the player starts out in jail. They are freed when <a href=\"/emperor-uriel-septim-vii/3005-289/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-289\">Emperor Uriel Septim VII</a> must use the escape passage that is conveniently located in their cell.

The next day, Bethesda announced that the game will run on a brand new engine. The game takes place in the land of Skyrim and includes many new features as well as tweaks and improvements. The world of Skyrim is 16 square miles and is much more rugged and mountainous than previous games. However, the entire game world is not rocky--there are open areas, such as the tundra where the player can find <a href=\"/mammoths/3015-4052/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4052\">massive mammoths</a>, <a href=\"/giants/3015-3464/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3464\">giants</a>, and other creatures roaming around. The climate is said to vary more than in Oblivion, with the expected snowy mountains contrasting with rugged taiga and lush forests. There are 150 handcrafted dungeons in the game.</p><p>The game uses an enhanced Radiant A.I. system that not only governs creature and civilian behavior but also quest behavior as well. When the player accepts a quest that takes them into a dungeon, for example, the game will put their objective inside of a dungeon that they have not yet visited. In addition, if a player murders a quest giver, any relatives they may have can give the quest and will have reactions to what the player has done.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1761586-es_4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1761586\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1761586-es_4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1761586\"><img alt=\"Dragons are a big focus in Skyrim\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/33529/1761586-es_4.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/3/33529/1761586-es_4.jpg 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/33529/1761586-es_4.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1761586-es_4.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/33529/1761586-es_4.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Dragons are a big focus in Skyrim\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/33529/1761586-es_4.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/3/33529/1761586-es_4.jpg 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/33529/1761586-es_4.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1761586-es_4.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/33529/1761586-es_4.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Dragons are a big focus in Skyrim</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to the improved A.I, Bethesda has made several gameplay changes as well. Players can now <a href=\"/dual-wielding/3015-135/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-135\">dual-wield</a> one-handed weapons, as well as spells. These spells can then be combined to produce more powerful effects. Another new gameplay mechanic is the addition of <a href=\"/thuum/3015-6677/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6677\">Dragon Shouts</a>, powerful mystical abilities that the player can only receive after learning the incantations and then absorbing the soul of a slain dragon.</p><p>One of the bigger changes is that character creation happens as you play. You pick a race, which gives your character different starting stats and special abilities, but for the most part, the player chooses what skills he or she will develop by practicing them, doing away with Daggerfall, Morrowind, and Oblivion's need for players to know what skills are significant and will aid the player's goals BEFORE the player has enough experience with the game world. Now the player can just play and find out what skills they need. They pick their role through action, and planning can only benefit this in terms of their character's thematic cohesion.</p><p>In addition to skills there are now perks, similar to the system from <a href=\"/fallout-3/3030-20504/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20504\">Fallout 3</a>, where upon leveling, skills you are experienced in can have extra bonuses attached which are chosen in trees. Each skill has its own perk tree.</p><p>Attributes, too, long used to help detail various statistical increases and skill synergy, are folded into the skills themselves. Instead of Intelligence dictating magic points, you simply have magic points. Instead of endurance contributing to health, you just have health. This conforms with the decision to prevent lack of knowledge of the game's engine preventing a player from making a character that conforms to their gameplay desires, while harder-core roleplayers can still make decisions that fall upon traditional lines.</p><p>In the world there are Guardian Stones, which are ways to further differentiate your character, at least temporarily. When you discover their locations, you are able to choose one of three, and they will boost certain abilities. The first set so far revealed divide their ability modifiers along the traditional Elder Scrolls line of Thief/Mage/Warrior, although other stones may have other types of differences. There are 13 <i>sets</i> of stones to be found in the game.</p><p>The main story line in Skyrim starts out with the player being taken to their execution as a prisoner along with some others. A dragon attack stops the execution, and the player escapes and sets out into the world to discover why the dragons have appeared.

href=\"/first-person-perspective/3015-330/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-330\">first-person</a> shooter franchise from <a href=\"/monolith-productions-inc/3010-864/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-864\">Monolith Productions</a>. The series is notable for its blend of open-ended shooting sections (with bullet-time) and atmospheric horror storytelling with nods to Japanese horror films like <i>The Ring.</i></p><p>The first game in the series--<a href=\"/fear-first-encounter-assault-recon/3030-4800/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4800\">F.E.A.R.: First Encounter Assault Recon</a>--was published by Vivendi Interactive in 2005 under the Sierra brand. Warner Bros. purchased Monolith shortly after the game's release, complicating the fate of F.E.A.R. due to Monolith's contract with Vivendi - Vivendi owned the name, while Monolith owned the story, characters, and mechanics. This led to Sierra releasing two non-canon expansions packs--<a href=\"/fear-extraction-point/3030-11787/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11787\">Extraction Point</a> and <a href=\"/fear-perseus-mandate/3030-15596/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15596\">Perseus Mandate</a>--both created by <a href=\"/timegate-studios-inc/3010-1503/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1503\">TimeGate Studios</a>. Meanwhile, Monolith worked on developing a full sequel in what was then just called Project Origin. Luckily, not long before Project Origin was finished, Warner Bros. was able to purchase all rights to the F.E.A.R. franchise from Vivendi in the wake of their merger with Activision, clearing the way for Project Origin to be rechristened with its final name, <a href=\"/fear-2-project-origin/3030-20663/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20663\">F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin</a>.</p><p><a href=\"/fear-3/3030-30484/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-30484\">F.E.A.R. 3</a> was developed by <a href=\"/wargaming-west/3010-5819/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-5819\">Day 1 Studios</a>, who had previously handled the console ports of F.E.A.R. 1. Esteemed horror director, <a href=\"/john-carpenter/3040-27465/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-27465\">John Carpenter</a>, contributed to the in-game cinematics and horror writer, <a href=\"/steve-niles/3040-38026/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-38026\">Steve Niles</a>, contributed to the game's script.</p><p> </p><h2>Characters</h2><h3>Point Man</h3><p><a href=\"/fear-point-man/3005-430/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-430\">F.E.A.R. Point Man</a> is the player character of Monolith Productions' F.E.A.R.: First Encounter Assault Recon and is a <a href=\"/silent-protagonist/3015-54/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-54\">silent protagonist</a>. He is a special forces soldier with superhuman reflexes. He was the first son of <a href=\"/alma-wade/3005-429/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-429\">Alma Wade</a> and <a href=\"/paxton-fettel/3005-1244/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1244\">Paxton Fettel</a>'s brother. Point Man was also the first prototype of Armacham Technology Corporation's Project Origin, but was deemed a failure. Little is known of how he exited Project Origin before going on to join the military.</p><p>Initially, the Point Man's role is to scout an abandoned facility and try to find <a href=\"/paxton-fettel/3005-1244/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1244\">Paxton Fettel</a>. After failing to capture Paxton at this location, Point Man and the rest of the F.E.A.R. team relocate to a water treatment plant, where the Hannibal-3 spy satellite had picked up a new signal from Fettels transmitter. There he sees <a href=\"/alma-wade/3005-429/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-429\">Alma</a> and Paxton and witnesses many gruesome flashbacks, but again Fettel escapes. The Point Man chases Fettel to the ATC headquarters. He fights through squads of Replica Soldiers, Battle Armour and ATC Security Personnel, who try to cover up the mess ATC had made. Point Man eventually meets and attempts to save Alice Wade. He catches up to Paxton Fettel, kills him, and then destroys the Project Origin facility.</p><h3>Alma Wade</h3><p>The mystery around this character is the core part of F.E.A.R.s horror element. She is a power psion and often appears to the player character, then shortly after disappears. It is unknown if they are visions due to the playable characters relation to Alma or if she really is there. Most of the time she appears as a little girl with black, long hair in a red dress, but later in the game she is seen in her physical, adult woman form.</p><p>Alma's childhood wasn't simple. She was a very powerful psion and often had nightmares, which was the effect of the negative emotions around her, to which she was very sensitive.</p><p>She is the daughter of Harlan Wade, who pioneered the Origin project. When Alma was seven, she was forced to participate in Armacham Technology Coprorations \"Project Origin\", with the aim of creating psionically capable supersoldiers. Two days before her 8th birthday, she was put into an induced coma and locked in the Vault, a secure location in the Origin facility. She was impregnated twice, the father being her own genes [test tube pregnancy]. The first prototype - the <a href=\"/fear-point-man/3005-430/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-430\">Point Man</a> - was born when she was 15. Her second child - <a href=\"/paxton-fettel/3005-1244/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1244\">Paxton Fettel</a> - was born shortly before the closure of the project. After the project was closed, the life support was cut and she died in six days.</p><p>Before the beginning of the game, the president of ATC - Genevieve Aristide - decides to reopen the Origin facility and continue the project, but all the teams she sends down, disappeared. With the facility open again, Alma uses her powers to synchronize with <a href=\"/paxton-fettel/3005-1244/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1244\">Paxton Fettel</a>'s mind and free him from his cell. Alma forces Paxton to find the Origin facility and free her physical form.</p><p>Alma is often seen in the game - sometimes standing in the shadows, running past the Point Man or behind windows, but she always disappears shortly after. She is one of the main horror elements in the game. She is heavily inspired by eastern horror.</p><p>Later in the game, when she is freed from her imprisonment, she appears as a naked, adult woman, instead of the little girl in red dress, which presumably was her psychic image.</p><p><b>Alma's Powers</b></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1479/299904-almapower.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-299904\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1479/299904-almapower.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-299904\"><img alt=\"Alma's liquifying power.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/1479/299904-almapower.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/1479/299904-almapower.jpg 1024w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/0/1479/299904-almapower.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/1479/299904-almapower.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Alma's liquifying power.</figcaption></figure><p>Because of Alma's telekinetic gifts, she has a number of powers she can possess whenever she pleases.

These vaults would house and protect privileged people from the atomic bombs. Unbeknown to almost everyone, the vaults were actually built for human research to test different psychological scenarios on the inhabitants.

Only a few vaults were actually made to work as they were advertised, but this was only to compare and contrast the data of those vaults to the experimental ones.

In the Capital Wasteland, however, the contingency stationed there focuses on protecting the people from Super Mutants. Because their goal differs from the rest of the faction, they receive no assistance from the west.

At the beginning of the game, the player has 150 in-game days to replace the water chip or the Vault Dwellers will die. However, the player can extend the time limit to 250 days if they get the merchants in the town of Hub to send water caravans to the Vault.</p><p>Once the chip is replaced, the player is tasked with destroying The Master (formerly known as Richard Grey) and his massive army of Super Mutants. The player can destroy him and the base in any order, but both most be completed in order to finish the game. There is more than one possible ending. If the player destroys the Master and the base, he returns to the Vault but is exiled because the Overseer believes that his iconic status will influence the children to leave and be like him.

The first one, \"Operation Anchorage\", takes place during the Chinese invasion of Alaska and had players fighting them off through a simulation. The second one, \"The Pitt\", takes place in Pittsburgh. The third one, \"Broken Steel\", continues the main quest after the initial end of Fallout 3 and raises the level cap. The fourth one, \"Point Lookout\", takes place in Maryland and introduces a brand new open area to explore.

Nuclear weapons play a prominent role; upno retrieving the launch codes, players can detonate nuclear weapons on the map, creating irradiated areas that spawn rare loot and attract deadlier enemies. At launch the game did not include any human NPCs to talk to, a break in convention from the rest of the series.</p><p>Fallout 76 was poorly received at launch due to the prevalence of bugs and controversies involving physical merchandise released with certain versions of the game.</p><h2>Canceled Games</h2><h3>Vault 13: A GURPS Post-Nuclear Adventure</h3><ul><li>Canceled: Around February 11, 1997</li><li>Platform: PC</li></ul><p>Vault 13: A GURPS Post-Nuclear Adventure (called Fallout: A GURPS Post-Nuclear Adventure later in development) was going to be a collaboration between Interplay and Steve Jackson Games. The game was going to use Steve Jackson's GURPS system, which stood for Generic Universal Role Playing System. However the two companies eventually decided to part ways after arguments on the creative and visual direction of the game. Interplay replaced the GURPS system with the <a href=\"/special-system/3015-318/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-318\">SPECIAL</a> system and rebranded the final product Fallout: A Post-Nuclear Adventure. As a reference to the <i>Fallout</i> franchise's history GURPS is sometimes a password on computer terminals in Fallout 3.</p><h3>Fallout Extreme</h3><ul><li>Canceled: 2000</li><li>Platforms: PS2, Xbox</li></ul><p>Fallout Extreme was going to be a squad-based first and third person tactical shooter for the Xbox and PS2. It was in development by Interplay for a few months in 2000 before being canceled. The game would have allowed for the player to switch control over 4 squad members, each having unique abilities. The game would have featured a world map that the player would move around and capture territories on. The story of the game begins with the player trying to fight the Brotherhood of Steel, who have rapidly expanded across much of what's left of America, with territory as far as Alaska. They are cruel to anyone they conquer, wastelanders and mutants alike. The crux of the first half of the game was freeing towns and fighting against the tyrannical Brotherhood. The plot changes when the player beats the Brotherhood of Steel and learn that the Brotherhood has been trying to expand into Asia to stop the Chinese from launching a massive nuclear missile to destroy what's left of America. After this the player fights their way through Alaska, Russia, Mongolia, and finally have a showdown with the Emperor of China in the Forbidden City. The game was also designed to have multiplayer with game modes like Capture the Flag and Deathmatch as well as being able to play through the campaign with other people. Almost all of the story in this game is considered non-canon, from the survival of many foreign nations such as Russia and China to the expansion of the Brotherhood of Steel.</p><h3>Fallout Tactics 2</h3><ul><li>Canceled: 2001</li><li>Platforms: PC</li></ul><p>Pre-production of a sequel to Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel began before the first game was released. <a href=\"/micro-forte-pty-ltd/3010-3519/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-3519\">Micro Forte</a>, the same developer that created Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel, was responsible for developing its sequel.

After the mediocre sales of Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel its sequel was canceled.</p><h3><b>Van Buren (Fallout 3)</b></h3><ul><li>Main Article: <a href=\"/van-buren/3030-32966/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-32966\">Van Buren</a></li><li>Canceled: December 8, 2003</li><li>Platform: PC</li></ul><p>Van Buren was a codename <a href=\"/black-isle-studios/3010-99/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-99\">Black Isle Studios</a> gave to the original Fallout 3 before it was canceled on 12/8/03 due to financial problems at parent company <a href=\"/interplay-entertainment-corp/3010-580/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-580\">Interplay</a> <a href=\"/interplay-entertainment-corp/3010-580/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-580\">Entertainment</a>.

The game was in development before the first Brotherhood of Steel was released. It was nearing completion in 2004 but Interplay laid off most of their employees. The plot of the game was going to relate to parts of Van Buren and Fallout Tactics 2. The story involved the Brotherhood of Steel having most of their technology destroyed and having to stop the results of a mutated G.E.C.K. from overrunning what's left of civilization as well as dealing with Caesar's Legion and other story elements that were planned to happen in Van Buren.</p><h3>Fallout Online (Project V13)</h3><ul><li>Main Article: <a href=\"/fallout-online/3030-25223/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-25223\">Fallout Online</a></li><li>Canceled: January 1, 2012</li><li>Platform: PC</li></ul><p>Fallout Online, codenamed Project V13, was Interplay's attempt to make an MMO set in the Fallout universe.</p>", "guid": "3025-183", "name": "Fallout"}, {"description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Family Feud is a popular TV game show with many versions worldwide.

Each game relies heavily on the horror game template, initially using a fixed camera perspective for the first three titles. Starting with the fourth game, the series utilizes an over-the-shoulder third person camera. The series sets itself apart by using less violence and gore and focusing on creating a tense and ultimately terrifying experience. Each game draws heavy influence from Japanese horror films such as the Pang Brother's, \"The Eye\" series and Takashi Shimizu's \"Ju-on: The Grudge\", which translates well into the horror franchise.</p><p>In 2012, <a href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-90\">Nintendo</a> partnered with Koei Tecmo to develop future Fatal Frame titles.

The game itself includes new gameplay elements which remained throughout the Real Bout Fatal Fury games, including a power gauge and ring-outs. <br/>\u00a0<br/>Over a year after the release of Real Bout Fatal Fury, SNK releases <a data-ref-id=\"3030-13463\" href=\"/real-bout-fatal-fury-special/3030-13463/\" slug=\"real-bout-fatal-fury-special\">      Real Bout Fatal Fury Special</a>, which brings back the two-plane system used in Fatal Fury Special.

The term \"street\" implies that a sport is taken and then turned into an over-the-top version of that sports that's heavy on superhuman tricks and light on realism.<br/><br/>The idea for FIFA Street probably came from street visions in cities such as Rio de Janeiro, where the poor kids have little else to do beside playing football. A football is often constructed with garbage found lying around in the street, but those kids don't mind. There is little space in the streets, especially in huge cities like Rio, so the kids don't have the room to play with passes and long balls. However, some of them start to build exceptional technique with the ball, and they think up tricks that will make an opponent think they are going to take the ball somewhere else than it'll go. They may also get really good at juggling tricks, which is a freestyle term for keeping the ball in the air.<br/><br/>It's from these scenes that the idea behind FIFA Street, and maybe Street games in general may have been born. <br/><br/></p><h2>Gameplay</h2>The gameplay in the Fifa Street series is quite simple, you have a keeper and either three (in the first two games) or four (in the third game) field players, in a small arena that allows you to freely use the walls to pass and do tricks. The object is, just like in real football to score goals. By doing tricks, you can build up a gamebreaker, which will allow you to perform a superpowered shot. The gamebreaker got refined in Fifa Street 2 and 3 to give it some extra qualities. A good thing about the gameplay is that as usual EA sports has put EA trax in the background that's very catchy.<br/><br/><h2>Graphical Style</h2>The first two Fifa Street games had a pretty realistic style, but EA felt that the gameplay was very over-the-top, so they redesigned the graphics in the third game to fit more with the ridiculous gameplay. The result was a very cartoony style where all the features of individual players were accentuated and exaggerated. The result is that players like Wayne Rooney are humongous, while a tiny player like Robinho is tiny in the game.

Beyond the <a href=\"/random-encounter/3015-123/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-123\">random battles</a> and <a href=\"/experience-points/3015-39/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-39\">experience points</a> typical to almost all RPGs, the first Final Fantasy laid down some aspects of the Final Fantasy franchise in particular that persisted throughout numerous subsequent installments. The story takes place in a world where four <a href=\"/elements/3015-160/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-160\">elemental</a> orbs control the forces of nature--earth, fire, wind, and water--but the orbs turn black and the forces go out of control. Four warriors come together to journey across the land in a quest to vanquish the monsters that have overrun the land and restore the orbs to their former splendor, saving the world form peril. Many Final Fantasy games have relied on these four elements as an essential device in their storylines.</p><h2>Other Mainline Final Fantasy Games</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/25/11460-AuronOverZanarkand.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-11460\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/25/11460-AuronOverZanarkand.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-11460\"><img alt=\"An FMV sequence from Final Fantasy X, the first PS2 entry in the series.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/25/11460-AuronOverZanarkand.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/25/11460-AuronOverZanarkand.jpg 640w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/25/11460-AuronOverZanarkand.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/25/11460-AuronOverZanarkand.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"An FMV sequence from Final Fantasy X, the first PS2 entry in the series.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/25/11460-AuronOverZanarkand.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/25/11460-AuronOverZanarkand.jpg 640w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/25/11460-AuronOverZanarkand.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/25/11460-AuronOverZanarkand.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>An FMV sequence from Final Fantasy X, the first PS2 entry in the series.</figcaption></figure><p>Some of the most important games in the franchise have added specific new mechanics or storytelling techniques.</p><ul><li><a href=\"/final-fantasy-ii/3030-2094/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2094\">Final Fantasy II</a> introduced a main cast of characters that were unique to the story, Cid, and chocobos.</li><li><a href=\"/final-fantasy-iii/3030-21463/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21463\">Final Fantasy III</a> implemented the <a href=\"/job-system/3015-298/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-298\">job system</a> (which lets party members learn special abilities associated with specific jobs), summoned monster attacks, and introduced the moogle.</li><li><a href=\"/final-fantasy-iv/3030-20829/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20829\">Final Fantasy IV</a> implemented <a href=\"/save-point/3015-51/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-51\">Save Points</a> where characters could save their progress and use Tents or Cabins to heal and d\u00e9buted the \" <a href=\"/active-time-battle/3015-95/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-95\">active time battle</a>\" system, which causes battles to proceed in a quasi-real-time fashion.

The series is heavily influenced by western medieval folklore, with the names of characters, weapons, and even nations taken from western history and mythology. The first game, <a href=\"/fire-emblem-ankoku-ryu-to-hikari-no-ken/3030-20805/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20805\">Fire Emblem: Ankoku Ryu to Hikari no Tsurugi</a>, was published for the <a href=\"/nes/3045-21/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-21\">Famicom</a> in 1990, and was one of the first, if not the first game in the strategy RPG subgenre. The series has seen thirteen full installments and one four-part <a href=\"/satellaview/3045-98/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-98\">Satellaview</a> release, but the series did not see a proper release in western markets until the seventh title, Fire Emblem: Rekka no Ken, simply called <a href=\"/fire-emblem/3030-1520/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1520\">Fire Emblem</a> in the west.</p><p>The name of the series, \"Fire Emblem,\" comes from a magic shield granted to <a href=\"/marth/3005-547/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-547\">Marth</a>, protagonist of the original Fire Emblem, by <a href=\"/nyna/3005-13478/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-13478\">Princess Nyna</a> of <a href=\"/archanea/3035-138/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-138\">Archanea</a>. Originally an item that gave Marth the ability to open any treasure chest without a key, the shield bears much greater significance in the plot of the sequel, <a href=\"/fire-emblem-monshou-no-nazo/3030-12309/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12309\">Fire Emblem: Monshou no Nazo</a>, as well as in the 3DS entry <a href=\"/fire-emblem-awakening/3030-36394/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-36394\">Fire Emblem: Awakening</a>. Since then, the term \"<a href=\"/fire-emblem/3015-4110/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4110\">Fire Emblem</a>\" has come to represent a specific item of power found in each of the distinct universes explored over the course of the series.</p><h2>Characters</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7705/216176-por_group.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-216176\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.974609375\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:97.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7705/216176-por_group.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-216176\"><img alt=\"Characters from Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/7705/216176-por_group.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7705/216176-por_group.jpg 1024w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/0/7705/216176-por_group.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/7705/216176-por_group.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/7705/216176-por_group.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Characters from Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance.</figcaption></figure><p>The casts of characters in Fire Emblem are quite large. The total number of playable characters available in the <a href=\"/wii/3045-36/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-36\">Wii</a> release of <a href=\"/fire-emblem-radiant-dawn/3030-14489/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14489\">Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn</a> numbers over seventy. Over the course of the franchise's history, the series has experimented with ways to bring out the personalities in such large casts. Latter games make use of a system based around the idea of <a href=\"/support-relationship/3015-2860/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2860\">support conversations</a>. In most games that this mechanic appears in, two characters with a predetermined affinity or story link to one another may engage in special conversations after spending enough time on battlefields together. The conversations reveal more about the characters' personalities and histories with the added gameplay benefit of providing stat bonuses when the two characters are within close proximity of each other on the battlefield.</p><h3>Character Death</h3><p>In Fire Emblem titles, characters that run out of Hit Points and fall in battle can no longer be used. Unlike many RPGs, when a character dies in a Fire Emblem game, there is no common method to revive them, making their deaths <a href=\"/permanent-death/3015-431/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-431\">permanent</a>. This forces the player to be judicious in their approach to battle, as sending in the wrong troops at the wrong time can lead to heavy losses. In latter games, however, starting with <a href=\"/fire-emblem-shin-monshou-no-nazo-hikari-to-kage-no-eiyuu/3030-31423/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-31423\">Fire Emblem: Shin Monshou no Nazo</a>, the player may choose to play in either Classic Mode, in which characters that run out of hit points will die, or Casual Mode; a more forgiving mode in which characters that run out of hit points don't die and are able to return in the next battle.</p><p>A few games present the player with an item called the <a href=\"/aum-staff/3055-5627/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-5627\">Aum Staff</a>; a single-use staff capable of resurrecting any dead character. This item only appears in the original Fire Emblem: Ankoku Ryu to Hikari no Tsurugi, it's <a href=\"/snes/3045-9/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\">Super Famicom</a> remake/sequel <a href=\"/fire-emblem-monshou-no-nazo/3030-12309/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12309\">Fire Emblem: Monshou no Nazo</a>, and the <a href=\"/nintendo-ds/3045-52/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-52\">DS</a> remakes, <a href=\"/fire-emblem-shadow-dragon/3030-24220/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-24220\">Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon</a> and Shin Monshou no Nazo. Further limiting the staff's usefulness, in the original game, it could only be used by <a href=\"/elice/3005-9639/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9639\">Elice</a> in the game's final chapter, but in later games, it can be used by a select few others.</p><h2>Settings</h2><p>Although some entries in the Fire Emblem series share settings with one another, the games are easily categorized by the continents on which they are set; some of these continents share the same world, while others exist in separate universes. Each of these separate universes feature their own distinct histories, politics, and other elements that define them.</p><h3><a href=\"/archanea/3035-138/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-138\">Archanea/Ylisse</a></h3><p>Archanea is the setting of more entries in the series than any other. These games include the original Fire Emblem: Ankoku Ryu to Hikari no Tsurugi, Fire Emblem: Monshou no Nazo, <a href=\"/bs-fire-emblem-akaneia-senki/3030-21372/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21372\">BS Fire Emblem: Akaneia Senki</a>, <a href=\"/fire-emblem-shadow-dragon/3030-24220/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-24220\">Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon</a>, and Fire Emblem: Shin Monshou no Nazo. Archanea is also the setting of <a href=\"/fire-emblem-awakening/3030-36394/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-36394\">Fire Emblem: Awakening</a>, where it is now known as Ylisse.

The game ends if the player's \"<a href=\"/lord/3015-7662/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7662\">Lord</a>\" character, typically the game's protagonist or another important figure, is killed in battle or if the player is otherwise prevented from completing the primary objective. Many missions also offer secondary objectives such as recruiting possible new allies and hunting for treasure. Some missions offer bonus objectives that, if completed, unlock a bonus chapter. These bonus chapters are usually filled with rare weapons, characters that could not otherwise be recruited, and extra insight into the game's main story.</p><p>Units may enter combat when positioned within range of an opponent and the option to attack is selected. In melee, the attacking unit must be adjacent to the target. Standard ranged attacks, such as arrows, magic attacks, or javelins feature a common maximum range of two squares. When combat is engaged, the attacker will attempt to strike the target. If the opponent is not killed by the blow, (s)he will have the opportunity to counterattack unless such an action is impossible. If the attacker has a much higher speed than the defender, the attacker may attack a second time after the opponent's counterattack. Further, when equipped with Brave-class weapons (ex: Brave Sword), the wielder will attempt two blows in a single attack.</p><p>Units that engage in battle earn <a href=\"/experience-points/3015-39/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-39\">experience points</a>. Those that engage in combat but don't kill the opposing unit will receive a small experience increase while an enemy's defeat grants a larger reward. Units that attack and defeat opponents that are of higher level will earn a proportionally larger amount of experience points. For every 100 experience points earned, units rise in level until the level cap is reached. When this occurs, the character must <a href=\"/class-change/3015-267/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-267\">promote</a> to a new, more powerful class in order to continue growing stronger. The actual act of promoting is handled differently from game to game. Some titles require the use of crests or other items that allow the unit to transition to their new class, while other games allow for automatic promotion upon reaching the level cap. Sometimes, class promotions for important characters are limited to story events and will occur regardless of the character's current level.</p><p>When units level up, the stats that increase are randomly chosen. Sometimes, only one stat may be increased, while three or four may be increased the next time the unit levels up. This random nature can lead to a peculiar quirk in the Fire Emblem leveling system, as sometimes characters will level up without receiving any stat growth at all. For further explanation on this aspect, please see the section \"Explanation of Random Number Generation\" below.</p><p>In between battles, most of the player's actions are made on the camp screen; a menu in which the player organizes and equips units, distributes bonus experience points (in the entries that award such), and in some games, engage in support conversations and visit shops. These latter two actions are not always available in camp, as some entries in the series place shops on the battle maps, and support conversations may also only occur during battle.</p><h3>The Weapon Triangle</h3><p>Most games in the Fire Emblem series base their combat around a concept called the <a href=\"/weapon-triangle/3015-2794/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2794\">Weapon Triangle</a>, a rock-paper-scissors relationship between the three primary weapon types. Namely, swords beat axes, axes beat lances, and lances beat swords. Pitting a sword-wielding unit against an axe user does not guarantee victory; rather, it gives a slight boost to possible damage dealt by the sword user while imposing a penalty on the axe wielder.</p><p>Bows, another common weapon type, exist outside of the Weapon Triangle. In most Fire Emblem games, archers are defenseless when pitted against an enemy in melee range. However, they are very strong against flying units such as <a href=\"/pegasus-knight/3015-7407/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7407\">Pegasus Knights</a> and Dracoknights.</p><h3>Trinities of Magic</h3><p>Similar to the Weapon Triangle, the Trinity of Magic defines the relationship between the different schools of magic. In the most common trinity, Anima magic beats Light magic, Light beats Dark, and Dark beats Anima. However, in some games, such as Fire Emblem: Seisen no Keifu and Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance, the Anima school is divided into its own trinity, in which Fire beats Wind, Wind beats Thunder, and Thunder beats Fire.</p><p>In Seisen no Keifu, this latter trinity exists alongside both Light and Dark. In this specific game's case, Light and Dark are neutral to one another, but both are strong against Anima. In Path of Radiance, the Dark school is not included, and Light magic is neutral against Anima. In Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn, both full trinity relationships exist, with the Anima-specific trinity existing inside the standard form.</p><h3>Weapon Degradation</h3><p>Weapons in Fire Emblem do not last forever. With the exception of a few unique weapons such as the swords <a href=\"/ragnell/3055-3075/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3075\">Ragnell</a> and <a href=\"/alondite/3055-3076/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3076\">Alondite</a> that appear in Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance and Radiant Dawn, all weapons have a set number of uses. When that number drops to zero, the weapon breaks. The maximum number of uses that a weapon offers typically declines in relation to the material type of the weapon. For example, an iron sword may offer forty uses to start with, whereas a more powerful silver sword may offer only thirty. As a result, players must ensure that their units are stocked with proper equipment to see them through each battle.</p><h2>Common Classes</h2><p>The exact line-up of classes that appear in each Fire Emblem title varies from game to game. Some unit types may appear as a playable class in one game only to be omitted from the next, or possibly only appear as an enemy unit type. However, there are a core set of classes that are commonly found throughout the series. Examples of these classes are listed below.</p><h3>Lord</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/348/182826-picture_1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-182826\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"2.1908713692946\" data-width=\"241\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 241px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:219.1%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/348/182826-picture_1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-182826\"><img alt=\"Marth, the first Fire Emblem lord, set the standard for later protagonists in the series.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 241px) 100vw, 241px\" data-width=\"241\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/348/182826-picture_1.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/348/182826-picture_1.png 241w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Marth, the first Fire Emblem lord, set the standard for later protagonists in the series.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/348/182826-picture_1.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/348/182826-picture_1.png 241w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 241px) 100vw, 241px\" data-width=\"241\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Marth, the first Fire Emblem lord, set the standard for later protagonists in the series.</figcaption></figure><p>Lords are traditionally the protagonists of each game. Most frequently, they are sword wielders, though some specialize in either lances or axes. Their importance to the story also makes them the most common unit type that cannot fall in battle, lest the current chapter end in failure. While some characters begin their respective games as lords, others promote to lord through either standard class promotion mechanics or through story progression. However, even when a lord character does not begin the game as such, their importance to the story and gameplay remain vital. Examples of lords include Marth, <a href=\"/leaf/3005-8036/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-8036\">Leif</a>, <a href=\"/eirika/3005-2125/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2125\">Eirika</a> and <a href=\"/ephraim/3005-2126/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2126\">Ephraim</a>.</p><h3>Cavalier/Paladin</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2714/319374-jeigan.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-319374\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.9452054794521\" data-width=\"146\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 146px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:194.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2714/319374-jeigan.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-319374\"><img alt=\"Jagen is the first paladin seen in the series.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 146px) 100vw, 146px\" data-width=\"146\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/2714/319374-jeigan.gif\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/2714/319374-jeigan.gif 146w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Jagen is the first paladin seen in the series.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/2714/319374-jeigan.gif\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/2714/319374-jeigan.gif 146w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 146px) 100vw, 146px\" data-width=\"146\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Jagen is the first paladin seen in the series.</figcaption></figure><p>Cavaliers, or horse-mounted knights, are able to cover long distances across the most standard terrain types. In most games in the series, they are capable of using swords and lances, while in Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance and Radiant Dawn, they are divided into distinct categories defined by their weapon specialization in either the sword, lance, axe, or bow. Upon promoting, cavaliers become paladins. Paladins feature an increased movement range, and in most games become capable of using any of the standard melee weapon types. In Path of Radiance and Radiant Dawn, paladins are allowed to select a second weapon proficiency upon promoting, and are allowed to use bows.</p><p>Most Fire Emblem titles begin with the player in control of one paladin. This character is much more powerful than the player's other units at the outset and is most effective in aiding the other units until they've leveled up enough to hold their own. Examples of cavaliers include <a href=\"/cain/3005-9789/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9789\">Cain</a>, <a href=\"/abel/3005-9788/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9788\">Abel</a>, <a href=\"/kent/3005-2049/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2049\">Kent</a>, <a href=\"/sain/3005-1929/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1929\">Sain</a>, <a href=\"/kieran/3005-2803/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2803\">Kieran</a> and <a href=\"/oscar/3005-2769/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2769\">Oscar</a>.

Depending on the game, they may make use of either fire, wind, and thunder magic (collectively known as anima), light magic, or dark magic.

Mages most commonly promote into sages, at which point they may gain the use of healing staves or, in some games, daggers.

The reason for this is because the game generates all of the random numbers for an entire level at the beginning of each level. In more technical terms, the game simply saves the random seed that it will use for the entire level at the beginning of each level. As such, you can exploit this and figure out how what the order of the random numbers will be on any given level. The way that the game's engine levels up a particular character's stats is by randomly generating seven numbers between 0 and 99. If that number is lower than the character's percent chance to get that stat, they will get one more point into that stat for that particular level up. For example, if an archer has an 80 percent chance to level up the Skill stat and the random number generated for that stat is 46, then they will get a point into skill.</p><p>A counter example would be if a character has a 40 percent chance to level up Skill and the random number generated is 62, in which case no stat growth is earned. The seven random numbers that are generated are used in the order which they appear on the level up screen, as shown to the picture on the right. The game goes down the left column first, followed by the right column, with all stats except Constitution having a chance to go up by a point.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8823/1326286-high.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1326286\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.74572127139364\" data-width=\"409\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 409px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.6%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8823/1326286-high.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1326286\"><img alt=\"The random number was high (50-99)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/8823/1326286-high.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/8823/1326286-high.png 409w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/8823/1326286-high.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The random number was high (50-99)\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/8823/1326286-high.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/8823/1326286-high.png 409w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/8823/1326286-high.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The random number was high (50-99)</figcaption></figure><p>The exploit itself comes into play when the player writes down approximately what random numbers are being generated for a particular level. It is only possible to accurately predict if the numbers generated are between 0 and 49 or between 50 and 99. This still significantly increases the odds to have certain statistics that have a low chance (below 50 percent) to be increased. At the beginning of any level, the player can take a Pegasus knight type unit and move the cursor around it in a circle as shown below. This represents the maximum movement range that a Pegasus knight has, and as such, when you move the cursor one more square north the game has to pick a different path for you to take to get there. Rather than hard coding in what path it would pick, the developers made the game randomly choose one of the two possible paths (to the left and then up OR up and then to the left).</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8823/1326287-low.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1326287\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75623268698061\" data-width=\"361\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 361px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.6%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8823/1326287-low.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1326287\"><img alt=\"The random number that was used was low (0-49)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/8823/1326287-low.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/8823/1326287-low.png 361w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/8823/1326287-low.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The random number that was used was low (0-49)\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/8823/1326287-low.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/8823/1326287-low.png 361w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/8823/1326287-low.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The random number that was used was low (0-49)</figcaption></figure><p>The way the game does this is by using one of the numbers randomly generated at the chapter's start. If the path moves to the left and then up, the number is between 50 and 99. Likewise, if the path the game chooses is up and then to the left, the number is between 0 and 49. It is preferable for the number to sit in the range of 0-49 for the purposes of exploiting the leveling system. As such, players can simply move the cursor around the Pegasus knight and write down whether the game generated a low or a high random number. Doing so several times in a row at the start of the chapter will allow the player to compile a list of random number possibilities that will remain valid for the entirety of the level.</p><p>Upon restarting the level, the same random numbers that were just written down will be used to dictate what happens in every encounter with the enemy and every level up. To effectively game the system, the player must time the usage of the random numbers in the game to line up seven low numbers in a row to ensure that the characters have the best chances to increase their stats when they level.</p><h3>Other Uses For Random Numbers</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8823/1326285-before.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1326285\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.69767441860465\" data-width=\"430\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 430px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:69.8%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8823/1326285-before.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1326285\"><img alt=\"The path the Pegasus Knight takes before it uses a random number.

For example, if the player enters a battle in which the player's unit will attack twice and the enemy will attack only once, so long as both units have a 0 percent chance to to score a critical strike the total number of numbers used will be 6. 2 for your initial attack, 2 for the enemy's attack, and then another 2 for your second attack. Using this, one can line up 7 low randomly generated numbers in a row and guarantee that they will have the best odds possible for a character's level up.</p><h2>Common Fire Emblem Character Tropes</h2><p>Over the course of the history of the series, a number of common character tropes have become well established.

Nintendo brought claims of copyright infringement against Enterbrain due to Tear Ring Saga's design, which very closely mirrored the design of the Fire Emblem series and was for some time during development known as Emblem Saga.</p><p>Nintendo won the lawsuit on appeal, but Tear Ring Saga remained on store shelves. Tirnanog eventually produced one sequel entitled <a href=\"/tear-ring-saga-berwick-saga/3030-27599/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-27599\">Tear Ring Saga: Berwick Saga</a>, but the series has been dormant ever since.</p>", "guid": "3025-196", "name": "Fire Emblem"}, {"description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>The Fire Pro Wrestling games are a Japanese developed series developed by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-312\" href=\"/spike-co-ltd/3010-312/\">Spike</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1209\" href=\"/human-entertainment-inc/3010-1209/\">Human Entertainment</a>. In contrast to most American wrestling titles, Fire Pro focuses more on precise timing and move planning than button mashing.

Up until that point, you could drive as recklessly as you'd like and there really was no penalty for doing so. <em>Forza</em> offered three levels of damage, cosmetic only, normal, and Simulation. On Simulation, you could do enough damage to your car to make it practically undrivable.</p><h4>Drivatars</h4><p><em>Forza Motorsport</em> featured excellent opponent AI that was aware of where you were on the track. The developers took this a step further and introduced the Drivatar feature where you could train the AI to mimic your driving style. The result was an AI driver that had your strengths and weaknesses but drove a little too consistently. This feature was later dropped in <em>Forza Motorsport 2</em>.</p><h4>Livery Editor</h4><p>Other games had allowed you to customize your car, but <em>Forza</em> took this to a whole new level. The Livery editor allowed you to use various shapes of decals to create your own unique designs. With a lot of time and some talent, you could make some truly spectacular car art. There were entire communities created around the game's Livery Editor, many of which are still going strong today.</p><h4>Online Play</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3227/241974-motor_city_muscle_chevelle_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-241974\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3227/241974-motor_city_muscle_chevelle_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-241974\"><img alt=\"Motor City Muscle Chevelle\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/3227/241974-motor_city_muscle_chevelle_2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/3227/241974-motor_city_muscle_chevelle_2.jpg 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/0/3227/241974-motor_city_muscle_chevelle_2.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/3227/241974-motor_city_muscle_chevelle_2.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/3227/241974-motor_city_muscle_chevelle_2.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Motor City Muscle Chevelle</figcaption></figure><p><em>Forza Motorsport</em> allowed you to take your custom cars online and race against the world over <a href=\"/xbox-live/3015-1404/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1404\">Xbox Live</a>. Up to eight players could race in a variety of game modes. The online component was expanded on for <em>Forza Motorsport 2</em> to include tournaments and an Auction House.</p><h4>Car Trades</h4><p>The game allowed you to trade cars with other people via Xbox Live. Initially, you had to set up a special trading session with someone else in order to get their cars. <em>Forza Motorsport 2</em> streamlined the process with its eBay style Auction House.</p><h4>Auction House</h4><p>The Auction House debuted in <em>Forza Motorsport 2</em> and was the much needed solution for people who wanted to sell their custom painted cars online. Instead of having to negotiate a one to one transaction, now you could simply list your car, set your minimum price and optionally set a buy-out price. The Auction House has become the hotbed for some of the finest car liveries around. There are also a few cars that can only be found via the Auction House; using the Livery Editor, many brilliant paint designs can be found thanks to the Auction House.</p><h4>Car Tuning</h4><p>Tuning up your cars for best performance is almost a black art. <em>Forza</em>'s tuning options let you adjust just about everything on the car, given you had the proper parts installed. Some people made quite a nice amount of in-game money by tuning other player's cars.</p><h2>Forza Horizon</h2><p><em>Forza Horizon </em>is the open world Forza series that uses many of the features found in <em>Forza Motorsport</em>. The games center around the fictitious Horizon Festival, a massive celebration of cars and music.

One of the major differences is the fact that World Heroes only uses three of the four Neo Geo buttons. Each of the three buttons preforms a specific function, be it kick, punch, or throw an opponent. In addition, the buttons can be held down for a larger effect. This three-button layout changed in the SNES version of World Heroes, and in later World Heroes games starting with <a data-ref-id=\"3030-16064\" href=\"/world-heroes-2-jet/3030-16064/\" slug=\"world-heroes-2-jet\">World Heroes Jet</a>.</p><p><a data-ref-id=\"3030-10827\" href=\"/world-heroes-perfect/3030-10827/\" slug=\"world-heroes-perfect\">World Heroes Perfect</a> adds a special move that can be triggered by holding down the A, B, and C buttons simultaneously.

The initial Adventure Island was the original Wonder Boy in all but appearance, but future Adventure Island games would become an <a href=\"/adventure-island/3025-745/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-745\">entirely separate series</a> with no connection to Westone's Wonder Boy. <a href=\"/sega/3010-62/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-62\">Sega</a> also published Wonder Boy for the Sega Master System, but left it intact.</p><p>In 1987 a sequel to Wonder Boy - named <a href=\"/wonder-boy-in-monster-land/3030-6949/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6949\">Wonder Boy in Monster Land</a> - was released in the Arcades, much like its predecessor. As with Wonder Boy, the game was picked up for home consoles by Sega who published Wonder Boy in Monster Land for the Sega Master System as well as Hudson for a game called Bikkuriman World on the newly released PC Engine/Turbografx-16. As was the case with Adventure Island, Bikkuriman World is more or less identical to Wonder Boy in Monster Land but for its character sprites, in this instance using the license of a popular Japanese collectible sticker series instead. Furthermore, <a href=\"/jaleco-ltd/3010-1033/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1033\">Jaleco</a> acquired the rights and released Saiyuuki World - another graphically-edited but otherwise identical version of Wonder Boy in Monster Land, but this time with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_to_the_West\" rel=\"nofollow \" data-ref-id=\"false\">Journey to the West</a> characters - on the Famicom in Japan only. Saiyuuki World saw a sequel unaffiliated with Wonder Boy, which in the US was renamed <a href=\"/whomp-em/3030-11428/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11428\">Whomp 'Em</a>.</p><p>To make matters more complicated, the Sega Master System version of Wonder Boy in Monster Land was named Super Wonder Boy: Monster World in Japan. This was the origin of the Monster World series.</p><p>There are two Wonder Boy IIIs: <a href=\"/wonder-boy-iii-monster-lair/3030-10133/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10133\">Wonder Boy III: Monster Lair</a> and <a href=\"/wonder-boy-iii-the-dragons-trap/3030-2192/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2192\">Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap</a> (or The Dragon's Curse in some cases). Monster Lair is the \"official\" Wonder Boy III, as it was released in Arcades first, like its antecedents. Monster Lair was ported to the Genesis by Sega and the PC Engine CD by Hudson, who decided to keep the Wonder Boy brand intact this time around. Though this was not the case for the US Turbografx-CD release, which was just named Monster Lair without the Wonder Boy name.</p><p>The Dragon's Trap, however, is a Sega Master System original that continued the story of Wonder Boy in Monster Land from where it left off. The game was intended to be called Monster World II in Japan (as the first SMS Wonder Boy in Monster Land had the Monster World subtitle in Japan) but the game was never released there - at that point, Sega had stopped supporting the Master System in Japan and was giving the Genesis/Mega Drive their full attention. However, the game was eventually released in Japan on the Game Gear and retained the Monster World II title.</p><p>Meanwhile, Dragon's Trap received a Turbografx-16 release via Hudson named simply Dragon's Curse, once again without the Wonder Boy part of its title. Oddly enough, the game was known as Adventure Island for its Japanese PC Engine CD release, despite having nothing to do with the more famous and now entirely separate Adventure Island series.</p><p>The next game in the series was the Genesis game Wonder Boy V: Monster World III, known in the US as <a href=\"/wonder-boy-in-monster-world/3030-9245/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9245\">Wonder Boy in Monster World</a>. This was the first use of the Monster World title in the US, hence no numeral, but it was the third such game in Japan to have that subtitle, after Monster World I (the SMS version of Wonder Boy in Monster Land) and Monster World II (the Game Gear version of Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Curse). Presumably because there had been two Wonder Boy IIIs, they skipped forward to V. For whatever reason Hudson released the game as The Dynastic Hero for the PC Engine with slightly different graphics.</p><p>Finally, there is <a href=\"/monster-world-iv/3030-3003/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3003\">Monster World IV</a>, which had until just recently been a Japan-only Sega Mega Drive exclusive, but is now available on Wii Shop and on the <a href=\"/sega-vintage-collection-monster-world/3030-38191/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-38191\">Sega Vintage Collection: Monster World</a> compilation for current consoles. The game is no longer affiliated with Wonder Boy, as Monster World IV has a new female protagonist named <a href=\"/asha/3005-23340/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-23340\">Asha</a>, but is sometimes referred to as Wonder Boy VI regardless.</p>", "guid": "3025-202", "name": "Wonder Boy"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-203", "name": "Freedom Force"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-204", "name": "Freespace"}, {"description": "\u00a0\u00a0", "guid": "3025-205", "name": "WipEout"}], "version": "1.0"}
