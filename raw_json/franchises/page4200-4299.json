Being the director also allows for event customization, wherein the player can determine the type of cars used in a race, time of day, and weather in a feature called Horizon Blueprint.</p><p>Forza Horizon 3 featured the largest multiplayer component yet in the series. Its main mode, Online Adventure, puts players in a championship series that awards points for finishing well in races and for skillful driving.</p><h4>Expansions</h4><ul><li><strong>Blizzard Mountain:</strong> A new map that introduces snow to the series and features new vehicles and events.</li><li><strong>Forza Horizon 3 Hot Wheels:</strong> An expansion created in collaboration with Mattel's Hot Wheels line of toys.

Forza Horizon 4's most significant introduction to the series is seasonal changes that occur every Thursday in the real world. Seasons bring new events and changes to the environment; for example, bodies of water freeze in the winter and can be driven on.</p><p>Forza Horizon 4 features a shared world with up to 72 players on a server together. Players encountered in the world can be challenged to races or invited to convoys, which allows them to join online events together. Hourly events called Forzathons occur, challenging participating players to complete three cooperative challenges and earn points that can be spent on cars and cosmetic items at the Forzathon Shop.</p><p>There are significantly more events and challenges in Forza Horizon 4 than in previous entries. Player progression is tied together in a concept called Horizon Life. Numerous progression trackers can be viewed, with various monetary, cosmetic, and vehicle awards available for reaching certain event type-specific milestones and completing specific challenges. For example, players have individual progression trackers for Road Racing, Cross Country Racing, Speed Traps, and even livery customization and car tuning.</p><p>As part of the Horizon Life concept, players acquire houses throughout the game world. These houses offer permanent passive bonuses, such as unlimited fast travel, and serve the same function as the Festival sites in previous games. The player character can be customized at these houses with outfits and gestures that are seen during loading screens and after events. These gestures include dances. Two of the dances--the \"Carlton\" and flossing--were removed in 2019 after <a href=\"/epic-games/3010-149/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-149\">Epic Games</a> faced lawsuits for including the same dances in <a href=\"/fortnite/3030-37030/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-37030\">Fortnite</a>.</p><p>Online Adventure returns in Forza Horizon 4, and players can create online races from any event in the game. Forza Horizon 4 also introduces a route creator, allowing players to create their own courses anywhere in the world. The feature quickly became dominated by short courses (less than 1 mile long) created to maximize XP and money gains.</p><p>At launch, Forza Horizon 4 did not feature vehicles from Toyota or Mitsubishi Motors due to licensing issues, but the brands were reintroduced in 2019.</p><h4>Expansions</h4><ul><li><strong>Fortune Island:</strong> A new map, with new cars and events, as well as a treasure hunting campaign to find 10 million credits.</li><li><strong>LEGO Speed Champions: </strong>A new map created out of LEGO pieces. Players construct their own Master Builder's house by completing challenges to earn bricks.</li></ul><h3><strong><a href=\"/forza-horizon-5/3030-82985/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-82985\">Forza Horizon 5</a> (2021)</strong></h3><p>NA</p><h2>Spin-Offs</h2><h3><strong><a href=\"/forza-horizon-2-presents-fast-furious/3030-48965/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-48965\">Forza Horizon 2 Presents Fast &amp; Furious</a> (2015)</strong></h3>", "guid": "3025-4463", "name": "Forza Horizon"}, {"description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Forza Motorsport is a subseries in the wider <a href=\"/forza/3025-199/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-199\">Forza series</a>, published by <a href=\"/xbox-game-studios/3010-340/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-340\">Xbox Game Studios</a>.
