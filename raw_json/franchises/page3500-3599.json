It was a defense game where players directed the aim of the Knight, who was seated atop a tower with a bow. The Knight would fire where the cursor pointed, and the goal was to keep the invading waves of enemies in each level from reaching the tower and destroying it. The tower could withstand a certain amount of damage before falling. There were also spells that could be triggered to attack enemies. Players earned experience from slaying monsters, and when they leveled up, could put points into enhancing their abilities.</p><p>Sentry Knight 2 was released later that same year. While it shared the same premise and gameplay as the original title, it offered a few changes. In addition to a revamped art style, the game included reworked skills and abilities and a significantly increased difficulty. For a one-time fee, players could unlock premium content in the game that included additional levels and several new spells.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/32/329323/2891175-sktcongb.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2891175\" data-ratio=\"0.685\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:68.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/32/329323/2891175-sktcongb.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2891175\"><img alt=\"Sentry Knight: Conquest\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/32/329323/2891175-sktcongb.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/32/329323/2891175-sktcongb.png 400w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/32/329323/2891175-sktcongb.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Sentry Knight: Conquest</figcaption></figure><p>In 2015, Sentry Knight: Conquest was sponsored and released by Armor Games. Unlike the first two titles, Sentry Knight: Conquest was an action game. Players controlled the Marksman as he moved freely around each level, dodging enemies and attacks while firing with his rifle. Players could still level up and improve abilities, but the game included several other mechanics, such as the ability to find and tame animals to fight alongside you. Sentry Knight: Conquest was also the first game in the series to feature a prominent plot, following the Marksman in his quest to deliver a message to the King after the death of a comrade at the hands of a mysterious figure.</p><p>Sentry Knight: Tactics was announced in 2015 on Armor Games and successfully Greenlit for distribution on Steam by the community in July of that same year.
