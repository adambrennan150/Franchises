The many expansions to the games has expanded the timeline up to 1399 - 1812, and added more detail to the Asian continent, which has always been less focused on in the games (as compared to Western Europe).</p><p>The games use diplomacy, warfare, and exploration as the main features, normally on a worldwide scale (excluding Crown of the North and Rome). The main focus of the games are the discovery and colonization of the <a data-ref-id=\"3035-505\" href=\"/new-world/3035-505/\" slug=\"new-world\">New World</a> by the European powers, but they also touch on the religious turmoil and diplomatic manoeuvrings in Early-Modern Europe. The rest of the world are not as fleshed out as Europe, but also play a large part in shaping the history of the games.</p><h2>Development</h2><p>Europa Universalis was built on the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1427\" href=\"/2d/3015-1427/\" slug=\"2d\">2D</a> Europa Engine, which has been in use for the majority of Paradox Interactive's games.

While not officially recognized as a sequel in advertisements, Radical Dreamers shares many key characters and helps link the plot of Chrono Trigger to Chrono Cross. Radical Dreamers is a text adventure with a variety of still and animated images, and limited player control; very different from other games in the franchise.<br /><br />Despite not having the backing of the \"dream team,\" several members of the original Chrono Trigger staff (including writer Masato Kato and composer <a data-ref-id=\"3040-48573\" href=\"/yasunori-mitsuda/3040-48573/\">                                                                                  Yasunori Mitsuda</a>) went on to develop Chrono Cross in 1999. Chrono Cross, while sharing many themes, concepts (especially time travel and the related concepts), characters, and places, Cross is not a direct sequel, but (as Masato Kato put it) a \"result\" of Chrono Trigger. While Chrono Cross does retain the role playing game style, the battle system is very different from the active time battle system seen in Chrono Trigger. <br /><br /><h3>Other Games   </h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/971997-chrono_trigger___jet_bike_special.000.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-971997\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.875\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/971997-chrono_trigger___jet_bike_special.000.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-971997\"><img alt=\"\u00a0BS Chrono Trigger: Jet Bike Special\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/971997-chrono_trigger___jet_bike_special.000.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/971997-chrono_trigger___jet_bike_special.000.png 512w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/971997-chrono_trigger___jet_bike_special.000.png 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/971997-chrono_trigger___jet_bike_special.000.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0BS Chrono Trigger: Jet Bike Special</figcaption></figure>   \u00a0  <br />The success of the franchise caused Chrono Trigger to be included in a PlayStation compilation titled <a data-ref-id=\"3030-14455\" href=\"/final-fantasy-chronicles/3030-14455/\">                                                                                 Final Fantasy Chronicles</a>, which also included <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20829\" href=\"/final-fantasy-iv/3030-20829/\">                                                                                Final Fantasy IV</a>.

While Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross do have different battle systems, there are key concepts that remain the same. Rather than being completely <a data-ref-id=\"3015-192\" href=\"/turn-based/3015-192/\">    turn based</a>, battling is done in an order (although the way that order is determined differs between the two games).

Exploration of the overworld is done on a large map displaying key locations, such as towns, caves, and forests. Going inside of these areas, players can interact with objects and people. Non playable characters are essential to each game, providing information, items, and triggering key events. As such, there is a wide variety of locations to explore in each game.   <figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1315769-sea_of_eden_chronopolis_.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1315769\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1315769-sea_of_eden_chronopolis_.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1315769\"><img alt=\"\u00a0Time travel is a common theme in the Chrono franchise.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/1315769-sea_of_eden_chronopolis_.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/1315769-sea_of_eden_chronopolis_.png 640w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/1315769-sea_of_eden_chronopolis_.png 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/1315769-sea_of_eden_chronopolis_.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"\u00a0Time travel is a common theme in the Chrono franchise.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/1315769-sea_of_eden_chronopolis_.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/1315769-sea_of_eden_chronopolis_.png 640w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/1315769-sea_of_eden_chronopolis_.png 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/1315769-sea_of_eden_chronopolis_.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0Time travel is a common theme in the Chrono franchise.</figcaption></figure><br />Each game has the ability to visit different worlds.

While the concept itself dates back to games such as <a data-ref-id=\"3030-11949\" href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda/3030-11949/\">                                                                   The Legend of Zelda</a>, Chrono Trigger coined the term \"New Game Plus.\" When starting a new game (after having already finished the game at least once), the player has the option of New Game Plus, which opens up a variety of options. For the Chrono franchise, this means <a data-ref-id=\"3015-27\" href=\"/multiple-endings/3015-27/\">                                                                 multiple endings</a>. Chrono Trigger had thirteen endings in the original SNES game, with other releases adding endings. Radical Dreamers features a variety of different modes after completing the game, each with multiple endings. Chrono Cross also features thirteen endings. Endings vary from serious (although not canonical) to completely ridiculous (such as one Chrono Trigger ending where the human race has been taken over by dinosaurs).<br /><br /><h3>Gameplay Differences   </h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/741134-chrono_trigger.081.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-741134\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.875\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/741134-chrono_trigger.081.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-741134\"><img alt=\"\u00a0Chrono Trigger uses the Active Time Battle system.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/741134-chrono_trigger.081.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/741134-chrono_trigger.081.png 512w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/741134-chrono_trigger.081.png 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/741134-chrono_trigger.081.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"\u00a0Chrono Trigger uses the Active Time Battle system.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/741134-chrono_trigger.081.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/741134-chrono_trigger.081.png 512w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/741134-chrono_trigger.081.png 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/741134-chrono_trigger.081.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0Chrono Trigger uses the Active Time Battle system.</figcaption></figure><br />As previously mentioned, the battle systems are drastically different from each other. Chrono Trigger uses the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-95\" href=\"/active-time-battle/3015-95/\">                                                                        Active Time Battle</a> system first used in Final Fantasy IV. Each character has a timer, and upon performing an action that timer is drained. The timer refills at a speed dependent on the character's speed stat, at which point the character can perform another action. Chrono Cross' battle system expanded on this idea with the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3569\" href=\"/stamina-bar/3015-3569/\">                                                                       stamina bar</a>. Each character in Chrono Cross has a stamina bar which players can then use to map out attacks based on how much stamina it will use up. This makes Chrono Cross' battle system much more turn based than Chrono Trigger's battle system.<br /><br />Magic and special attacks are applied differently, particularly in Chrono Cross. Chrono Cross uses an <a data-ref-id=\"3015-160\" href=\"/elements/3015-160/\">                                                                      Elements</a> system. Elements can be purchased and collected, and then equipped to a character. Every character and enemy has a preexisting Element alignment. Elements of that color are very effective against Elements of the opposite color, whereas it is very weak to Elements of the same color. Therefore, if an enemy has a Red Element (fire) then the opposite Element would be the Blue Element (water). <br /><br />Chrono Trigger uses the \"Tech\" (short for technique) system used in other Final Fantasy games. Each character can use a variety of Techs, even if they don't have a magical ability (as Techs are merely special attacks). Chrono Trigger expands the idea of Techs, and allows players to combine characters' Techs, creating massive attacks sometimes requiring all present characters. While dual and triple Techs do require a much higher amount of MP (magic power), the payoff is a much larger effect (either in affected area or general damage).   <figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/814952-bs_radical_dreamers__j___t_eng1.2_demiforce__00007.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-814952\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.875\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/814952-bs_radical_dreamers__j___t_eng1.2_demiforce__00007.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-814952\"><img alt=\"\u00a0Radical Dreamers has limited battles, where the player has some control.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/2840/814952-bs_radical_dreamers__j___t_eng1.2_demiforce__00007.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/2840/814952-bs_radical_dreamers__j___t_eng1.2_demiforce__00007.png 256w\"><noscript><img alt=\"\u00a0Radical Dreamers has limited battles, where the player has some control.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/2840/814952-bs_radical_dreamers__j___t_eng1.2_demiforce__00007.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/2840/814952-bs_radical_dreamers__j___t_eng1.2_demiforce__00007.png 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0Radical Dreamers has limited battles, where the player has some control.</figcaption></figure><br />Radical Dreamers is the \"black sheep\" of the franchise, differing from the other games. Gameplay in Radical Dreamers largely consists of a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2199\" href=\"/text-based/3015-2199/\">  text</a> adventure. However, there are instances where the player must choose an action in order to fight or react in a situation. In some areas of the game, hesitation or choosing the wrong option results in the injury or death of the main character, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1766\" href=\"/serge/3005-1766/\">                                                                     Serge</a>. In addition, damage inflicted upon Serge is tracked and factors into the main female lead, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1591\" href=\"/kid/3005-1591/\">                                                                    Kid</a>, and her attraction towards Serge. This, in turn, factors into whether or not Serge lives in the final conflict.<br /><br /><h2>Plot Outline</h2><h3>Chrono Trigger   </h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10967/229585-lavos.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-229585\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.44921875\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:44.9%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10967/229585-lavos.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-229585\"><img alt=\"Lavos is the central enemy in Chrono Trigger\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/10967/229585-lavos.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/10967/229585-lavos.jpg 256w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Lavos is the central enemy in Chrono Trigger\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/10967/229585-lavos.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/10967/229585-lavos.jpg 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Lavos is the central enemy in Chrono Trigger</figcaption></figure>   \u00a0  <br />Chrono Trigger follows the story of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1242\" href=\"/crono/3005-1242/\">                                                               Crono</a> and his companions (<a data-ref-id=\"3005-1248\" href=\"/lucca/3005-1248/\">                                                              Lucca</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1251\" href=\"/marle/3005-1251/\">                                                             Marle</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1269\" href=\"/robo/3005-1269/\">                                                            Robo</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1270\" href=\"/ayla/3005-1270/\">                                                           Ayla</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1224\" href=\"/frog/3005-1224/\">                                                          Frog</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1230\" href=\"/magus/3005-1230/\">                                                         Magus</a>) after discovering the end of the world. The game begins with Crono meeting his friend Lucca, and testing out her teleportation panels. When a freak accident sends Marle back to the year 600 A.D., Crono and Lucca investigate. The three manage to escape through a gate (essentially a portal to a different time period), and end up in the year 2300 A.D. Here, they discover a video of the end of the world--1999 A.D., the day of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2278\" href=\"/lavos/3005-2278/\">                                                        Lavos</a>. Together, they vow to prevent this from stopping. <br /><br />After a series of events, the team expands with Robo (a robot from 2300 A.D.), Ayla (a cavewoman from 65,000,000 B.C.), and Frog (a swordsman from 600 A.D. who is cursed to forever be a frog). The team discovers that Lavos came to the planet in 65,000,000 B.C., and has ever since then been extracting DNA from the planet and altering its course to Lavos' bidding. While researching how Lavos was triggered to the surface in 1999 A.D., they discover that Lavos has surfaced three times total. Once in 600 A.D. (triggered by Magus), once in 12,000 B.C., and last in 1999 A.D. <br /><br />From here, the group travels to 12,000 B.C., where they discover the technologically and magically advanced Kingdom of Zeal, whose crazed queen is attempting to harness Lavos' power with the Mammon Machine. Here, Queen Zeal is forcing her daughter, Schala, to use her incredible magical power to power the Mammon Machine. Schala is incredibly reluctant to help her mother, and even assists the group by keeping her mother's prophet from killing them. While gathering information in 12,000 B.C. the group attracts the attention of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-5160\" href=\"/queen-zeal/3005-5160/\">                                                       Queen Zeal</a>, who commands her prophet to kill them, but he opts to banish them from coming to that era.<br /><br />In an attempt to revisit that era, the group finds a time machine in 2300 A.D. known as the <a data-ref-id=\"3055-299\" href=\"/epoch/3055-299/\">                                                      Epoch</a>, which they use as their primary mode of transportation. They come in time to find the Mammon Machine awaking Lavos. Here, Magus attempts to kill Lavos a second time (his first attempt was thwarted by the group in 600 A.D). When everyone is wiped out, Crono attempts to kill Lavos in a final attempt, only to be brutally murdered.   <figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7715/211098-epoch.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-211098\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.82800982800983\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:82.8%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7715/211098-epoch.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-211098\"><img alt=\"\u00a0The Epoch is a flying time machine\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/7715/211098-epoch.gif\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7715/211098-epoch.gif 407w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/7715/211098-epoch.gif 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"\u00a0The Epoch is a flying time machine\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/7715/211098-epoch.gif\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7715/211098-epoch.gif 407w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/7715/211098-epoch.gif 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0The Epoch is a flying time machine</figcaption></figure><br />From here, it is optional to regain Crono and gain the party member of Magus. If the player chooses to find Crono, they are given the Time Egg by <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3619\" href=\"/gaspar/3005-3619/\">                                         Gaspar</a>, a powerful magic user from the Kingdom of Zeal who was banished for opposing Queen Zeal. The team is able to use the Time Egg and a dopple doll of Crono to return to the exact moment where he died, and replace him with the doll. After saving Crono, the team can do a variety of optional sidequests, such as defeating a crazed artificial intelligence in 2300 A.D., creating a forest in 600 A.D., defeating the Mystics, dethroning the corrupt <a data-ref-id=\"3005-6369\" href=\"/chancellor/3005-6369/\">                                        Chancellor</a>, or recharging the mythical object known as the Sun Stone.\u00a0 <br />\u00a0<br />Regardless of whether or not Crono is regained, the remaining members manage to defeat Queen Zeal, and subsequently fight Lavos. After defeating Lavos, the group celebrates in 1000 A.D. at the Millennial Fair, reconciling and then proceeding to leave their separate ways (if Magus is present, he leaves to search for his sister Schala, which he is still doing in the sequel, Radical Dreamers). Depending a variety of factors (especially whether or not the game is a New Game Plus), the ending can be one of thirteen different endings. <br /><br /><h3>Radical Dreamers   </h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/814005-bs_radical_dreamers__j___t_eng1.2_demiforce__00010.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-814005\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.875\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/814005-bs_radical_dreamers__j___t_eng1.2_demiforce__00010.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-814005\"><img alt=\"\u00a0The team sets out on their adventure.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/2840/814005-bs_radical_dreamers__j___t_eng1.2_demiforce__00010.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/2840/814005-bs_radical_dreamers__j___t_eng1.2_demiforce__00010.png 256w\"><noscript><img alt=\"\u00a0The team sets out on their adventure.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/2840/814005-bs_radical_dreamers__j___t_eng1.2_demiforce__00010.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/2840/814005-bs_radical_dreamers__j___t_eng1.2_demiforce__00010.png 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0The team sets out on their adventure.</figcaption></figure><br />Radical Dreamers follows Serge (a carefree magician who met Kid before the events of the game), Kid (a young thief who is literally the reincarnation of Schala from Chrono Trigger), and Magil (who is actually Magus, but has since changed his name), three treasure hunters. This team is searching for the Frozen Flame, a mythical object which is said to have the ability to grant any wish. <br /><br />In order to get the Frozen Flame, they must infiltrate Viper Manor, home of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-5116\" href=\"/lynx/3005-5116/\">                                                     Lynx</a>. On the night that the group infiltrates Viper Manor, Magil explains how the Frozen Flame is, in actuality, a piece of Lavos that was blown off when he landed on the planet. Continuing to explore Viper Manor, they discover the underground Kingdom of Zeal, which sank into the earth long ago when Lavos emerged briefly. Here, Kid's true intentions are revealed; she wants to get revenge on Lynx for killing her foster mother, Lucca. <br /><br />In possession of the Time Egg (also known as the Chrono Trigger), Kid shatters it in the presence of Lynx and the Frozen Flame. This causes time to literally stop while the group is able to see brief scenes from Kid's life. Her life as <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2267\" href=\"/schala/3005-2267/\">                                                    Schala</a> is seen, and how she was forced to use her magical prowess to assist her mother, Queen Zeal, in her intentions to use Lavos' power. After the end of Chrono Trigger, Schala was incredibly guilt-ridden. The Frozen Flame was able to sense her guilt, and sent her forward in time as a child, where she was found by Lucca. Here, it is also revealed that Magil is Schala's brother, Janus (who also goes by the name Magus). <br /><br />After the Chrono Trigger's power dies down, the nation of Porre sends an army into the mansion.

The game stars Serge, who slips into an alternate dimension at the beginning of the game. In this alternate dimension, he has died ten years before when he was killed by his corrupted father, Wazuki. After meeting up with Kid, he learns that when she came back in time to save him, it caused a split in space and time. Kid is in possession of an amulet which allows them to travel between the two dimensions (Home world and Another world).<br /><br />While in Fort Dragonia, they meet Lynx, who (unbeknownst to Kid) switches bodies with Serge. Therefore, while Kid talks to Lynx, the real Serge stands by, completely helpless as he stabs her. Believing to be victorious, Lynx banishes Serge to the Temporal Vortex, and then takes Kid as his own, tricking her into believing that the real Serge is her enemy.    <figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11847/525643-2400.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-525643\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"2.2765957446809\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:227.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11847/525643-2400.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-525643\"><img alt=\"\u00a0Kid, the main female lead.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px\" data-width=\"281\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/11847/525643-2400.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/11847/525643-2400.jpg 282w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/11847/525643-2400.jpg 281w\"><noscript><img alt=\"\u00a0Kid, the main female lead.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/11847/525643-2400.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/11847/525643-2400.jpg 282w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/11847/525643-2400.jpg 281w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px\" data-width=\"281\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0Kid, the main female lead.</figcaption></figure><br />After managing to escape the Temporal Vortex with help from <a data-ref-id=\"3005-5349\" href=\"/harle/3005-5349/\">                                                   Harle</a>, he discovers that he is now unable to travel between dimensions. Trapped in Home world, he visits the Dead Sea, where a man named Miguel is living (who is under control of a supercomputer named FATE, the same computer that corrupted Serge's father). With help from three visions of Lucca, Crono, and Marle, Miguel explains that if Serge were able obtain the Frozen Flame, Home world would be doomed to destruction. In order to prevent this from happening, the Dead Sea is destroyed by FATE. <br /><br />After allying himself with the powerful six Dragons, Serge is able to make it to Another World. He is able to find the Dragon Tear of Another world, which allows him to transform back into his human form. While visiting Another world's version of the Dead Sea (Sea of Eden), he finds a research facility known as Chronopolis, which is researching time and space.<br /><br />Inside Chronopolis, he finds Lynx and Kid. After defeating Lynx and the supercomputer FATE, the six dragons steal this dimension's Frozen Flame, and merge to form the Dragon God (creating a new villain).

He explains that Chronopolis was pulled into time thousands of years ago. The fact that Chronopolis was pulled from the future forced the planet to counterbalance this by pulling Dinopolis from the past. Dinopolis, the city of Dragonians (a reptile-like race) was constantly at war with Chronopolis. Chronopolis managed to defeat Dinopolis, and took the Dragon God captive. <br /><br />They split the Dragon God into six different pieces, each representing a different Element (explaining the Element system used in the battle system). FATE then created the island paradise of El Nido. The supercomputer sent the scientists of Chronopolis to live in the newly created island paradise, while also erasing their memories. Thousands of years passed while the supercomputer went unchallenged, until Serge was attacked by a demon and badly wounded. His father attempted to bring him to the city of Marbule, but unfortunately, they were not able to make it there due to a storm caused by Lavos, who was in the process of being merged with Queen Zeal's daughter, Schala.<br /><br />Ever since Schala had been launched forward in time and turned into Kid, she had simultaneously existed in the Darkness Beyond Time, where Lavos was trapped. Here, she was being merged with Lavos to form the Time Devourer. The storm that she caused not only knocked the ship off course, but also caused Chronopolis' defenses to be knocked out, and allowed Serge to find the Frozen Flame, which healed him and corrupted his father (who became Lynx). This magical storm also put a lock on FATE's ability to use the Frozen Flame.    \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1315802-schala.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1315802\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"2.9335793357934\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:293.4%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1315802-schala.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1315802\"><img alt=\"\u00a0Schala is merged with Lavos to form the Time Devourer.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 218px) 100vw, 218px\" data-width=\"218\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/1315802-schala.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/1315802-schala.jpg 271w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/1315802-schala.jpg 218w\"><noscript><img alt=\"\u00a0Schala is merged with Lavos to form the Time Devourer.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/1315802-schala.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/1315802-schala.jpg 271w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/1315802-schala.jpg 218w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 218px) 100vw, 218px\" data-width=\"218\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0Schala is merged with Lavos to form the Time Devourer.</figcaption></figure><br />Attempting to remove this lock, FATE sent Lynx to attack Serge. Kid caused the split in dimensions when she went back in time ten years to save Serge from drowning, locking FATE out of the Frozen Flame once again. Knowing that Serge would have to face him eventually, FATE began preparing for this inevitable conflict by sending Lynx to switch bodies with him. In the end, Belthasar reveals that all of these events were part of a project that he orchestrated, called Project Kid, in which he was attempting to make Serge powerful enough to free Schala from merging with Lavos (creating the Time Devourer, a creature able to destroy space and time itself). <br /><br />Now aware of all of this, Serge uses the Chrono Trigger to teleport to the Darkness Beyond Time, where he defeats the Time Devourer and frees Schala. Not only does this free Schala, but it restores space and time as well, merging the Home world and the Another world into the Ideal world. In the ending scenes, Schala tells Serge that he will forget all of his experiences before he is returned to his home. However, some of the final images include a wedding picture of Serge and Kid.<br /><br /><h2>Plot Connections\u00a0 <br /></h2><h3>Project Kid   </h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/966376-belthasar.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-966376\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.6101694915254\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:161.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/966376-belthasar.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-966376\"><img alt=\"\u00a0Belthasar is the Guru of Reason, and the mastermind of Project Kid\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 177px) 100vw, 177px\" data-width=\"177\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/966376-belthasar.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/966376-belthasar.jpg 177w\"><noscript><img alt=\"\u00a0Belthasar is the Guru of Reason, and the mastermind of Project Kid\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/966376-belthasar.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/966376-belthasar.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 177px) 100vw, 177px\" data-width=\"177\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0Belthasar is the Guru of Reason, and the mastermind of Project Kid</figcaption></figure>   \u00a0  <br />Masterminded by Zeal's Guru of Reason, Project Kid is an enormous plan in which <a data-ref-id=\"3005-10563\" href=\"/belthasar/3005-10563/\">            Belthasar</a> plotted out the exact events of Chrono Cross in incredibly excruciating detail.

The ultimate goal of his incredible project was to assist Serge in becoming powerful enough to face Lavos and defeat the Time Devourer.<br /><br />The plan encompasses a wide array of factors, including FATE, the Dragon God, the Prometheus Circuit, and even requiring direct actions of people, such as Kid. In Chrono Trigger, when he is launched through the temporal distortion caused by Lavos, he is sent to 2300 A.D. Instead of a desolate future (as found in the game), he finds a new future, which has been forged after the defeat of Lavos. After learning of the Time Devourer, he set out on forging Project Kid.   <figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1316256-psxtimecrash.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1316256\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.7\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1316256-psxtimecrash.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1316256\"><img alt=\"\u00a0The Time Crash\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/1316256-psxtimecrash.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/1316256-psxtimecrash.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"\u00a0The Time Crash\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/1316256-psxtimecrash.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/1316256-psxtimecrash.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0The Time Crash</figcaption></figure><br />After founding Chronopolis, a city where time and space are researched, Belthasar succeeds in sending the entire city back in time in the \"Counter-Time Experiment,\" a portion which came to be called the Time Crash. Dinopolis was sent along with Chronopolis, triggering the battle between FATE and the Dragon God (all part of Project Kid).<br /><br />In addition to time manipulation on a massive scale, Belthasar was present in individual lives as well. He approached Kid sometime after 1015 A.D., instructing her to, at some point, return back to 1010 A.D., where she saved Serge from being murdered by his corrupted father. Although FATE did play a part in the corruption, this was all part of Belthasar's plan to prepare Serge for the ultimate goal of forging the Chrono Cross and saving Schala.<br /><br />Almost all of the events of Chrono Cross are orchestrated by Belthasar, giving him ultimate--almost godlike--power. As such, his motives have been questioned, with some speculating that he reached a level of insanity breaching on megalomania.

After being overcome with grief and guilt, the Frozen Flame sensed Schala and sent her to the Darkness Beyond Time. She was trapped here, merging with Lavos to form the \"Dream Devourer\" (the first stage, which is explained in Chrono Trigger DS). After years of transformation, the two culminate to from the Time Devourer, a beast capable of destroying time itself.<br /><br />Schala, in a brief moment of self-consciousness, feels that she is losing her identity and any sense to Lavos. To combat this, she sends a child clone of herself to the future, along with a pendant. This child, named Kid, is found by Lucca, who continues to care for the child for several years.<br /><br /><h3>Prometheus Circuit   </h3> <br />A creation of Lucca's after the events of Chrono Trigger, and part of the massive Project Kid, the Prometheus Circuit is essentially a device which protects the Frozen Flame. Belthasar convinced Robo, a main playable character from Chrono Trigger, to become the Prometheus Circuit. The Prometheus Circuit's key role in Chrono Cross is to protect the Frozen Flame, locking FATE out of using it once Serge has touched it. When Serge touched it, he became the Arbiter of the Frozen Flame, preventing anyone else from using it. This accounts for a large part of Serge's initial progression in Chrono Cross, as FATE acts as the main villain for some time in the game.<br /><br /><h3>Frozen Flame   </h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1316259-picture_3.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1316259\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.69648562300319\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:69.6%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1316259-picture_3.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1316259\"><img alt=\"\u00a0The Frozen Flame\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 313px) 100vw, 313px\" data-width=\"313\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/1316259-picture_3.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/1316259-picture_3.png 313w\"><noscript><img alt=\"\u00a0The Frozen Flame\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/1316259-picture_3.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/1316259-picture_3.png 313w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 313px) 100vw, 313px\" data-width=\"313\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0The Frozen Flame</figcaption></figure><br />Although the Frozen Flame is never directly referenced in Chrono Trigger, its origins can be traced back to the first game. In 65,000,000 B.C., when Lavos first crashed down to earth, a fragment broke off. This fragment lay dormant until millions of years later, when in 3,000,000 B.C., when it made contact with early humans and launched the evolutionary cycle forward.<br /><br />From that point until 2300 A.D., the Frozen Flame's usage is unknown. It has been speculated that it was used in the rise and fall of Zeal, but nothing solid in the games or related media has alluded to this. Regardless, in 2300 A.D., Belthasar used the Frozen Flame as Chronopolis' primary power source. In researching the Frozen Flame, Belthasar used it in experiments in manipulating time.<br /><br />The Frozen Flame is used as a central part of Chrono Cross' plot, as well as Radical Dreamers' plot. In Radical Dreamers, the group is searching for it in Viper Manor, Lynx's mansion. The team (and Lynx) believe that when using the Frozen Flame and the Time Egg in conjunction, the user can control time. <br /><h2>Characters</h2><h3>Crono   </h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4245/363994-cronotrigger02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-363994\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.75102040816327\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.1%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4245/363994-cronotrigger02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-363994\"><img alt=\"\u00a0Crono in one of the animated cutscenes of Chrono Trigger DS.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4245/363994-cronotrigger02.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/4245/363994-cronotrigger02.jpg 490w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4245/363994-cronotrigger02.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4245/363994-cronotrigger02.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"\u00a0Crono in one of the animated cutscenes of Chrono Trigger DS.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4245/363994-cronotrigger02.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/4245/363994-cronotrigger02.jpg 490w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4245/363994-cronotrigger02.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4245/363994-cronotrigger02.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0Crono in one of the animated cutscenes of Chrono Trigger DS.</figcaption></figure>   \u00a0  <br />The main protagonist of Chrono Trigger, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1242\" href=\"/crono/3005-1242/\">                          Crono</a> is a young boy from the town of Truce. Here, he is best friends with Lucca, an intelligent inventor. When he wakes up one morning for the Millennial Fair, he meets Marle, a beautiful young woman who decides to explore the fair with him. After an accident involving Lucca's teleportation panels that sends Marle back in time 400 years, Crono goes after her.<br /><br />Throughout the rest of the game, his role is center and singular as the main protagonist, until the near end of the game. When the group faces Lavos for the first time in 12,000 B.C., Crono is killed. Here, it is optional to go through a process to save him and regain him as a party member.<br /><br />Crono appears and is referenced several times in Chrono Cross. Several characters talk about how the Kingdom of Guardia (Crono's home kingdom) is now unsafe, alluding to his fate. However, a letter from Lucca talking about her friends could possibly mean that he is still alive. Regardless, he appears three times as an apparition, assisting Serge in his journey.<br /><br /><h3>Lucca   </h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6974/190391-lucca.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-190391\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.6666666666667\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:166.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6974/190391-lucca.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-190391\"><img alt=\"Lucca, Crono's best friend and a genius inventor\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px\" data-width=\"384\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/6974/190391-lucca.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/6974/190391-lucca.jpg 471w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/6974/190391-lucca.jpg 384w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Lucca, Crono's best friend and a genius inventor\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/6974/190391-lucca.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/6974/190391-lucca.jpg 471w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/6974/190391-lucca.jpg 384w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px\" data-width=\"384\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Lucca, Crono's best friend and a genius inventor</figcaption></figure><br /><a data-ref-id=\"3005-1248\" href=\"/lucca/3005-1248/\">                         Lucca</a> is a young, intelligent inventor and the best friend of Crono. She plays a major role in Chrono Trigger and minor roles in both Radical Dreamers and Chrono Cross. Her inventions help the plot of Chrono Trigger, particularly her teleportation panels (the Super Dimension Warp machine) and her large robot, Gato. She develops a bond with Robo, the robot she repairs in 2300 A.D.<br /><br />Her desire to know technology and science is stemmed back to an incident when her mother lost her legs. Her mother yelled for Lucca to help, but she was unable to because she did not have enough knowledge of the machine to stop it in time. At one point, Lucca is able to return to this moment and save her mother, going through a red gate. This red gate is presumed to have been provided by Entity, a living creature which is directly referenced in Chrono Trigger, but is never given any clear details. Some fans speculate that Entity may even be the planet itself, or an unnamed deity.<br /><br />After the events of Chrono Trigger, Lucca founded an orphanage in the city of Regiorra. It was here that she raised Kid in 1004 A.D., the clone of Schala. As she continued to research circuit boards and temporal science, she was able to develop technology that is used in Chrono Cross, such as incomplete Time Eggs. After designing the Prometheus Circuit (an altered version of Robo which prevented FATE from using the Frozen Flame), she was murdered by Lynx and Harle when they burned her house to the ground.<br /><br /><h3>Magus   </h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/149/254772-ct_janus.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-254772\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.7741935483871\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:177.4%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/149/254772-ct_janus.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-254772\"><img alt=\"\u00a0Janus, Magus as a child.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 310px) 100vw, 310px\" data-width=\"310\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/149/254772-ct_janus.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/149/254772-ct_janus.jpg 310w\"><noscript><img alt=\"\u00a0Janus, Magus as a child.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/149/254772-ct_janus.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/149/254772-ct_janus.jpg 310w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 310px) 100vw, 310px\" data-width=\"310\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0Janus, Magus as a child.</figcaption></figure><br /><a data-ref-id=\"3005-1230\" href=\"/magus/3005-1230/\">                        Magus</a> is a key player in the events surrounding the Kingdom of Zeal, as well as being a main playable character in Radical Dreamers. He was born as Janus, the son of Queen Zeal, brother of Schala, and a powerful magic user. As a child, he was quiet, but this was largely due to grief from his magical abilities (which allowed him to see into the future). He cared for few people, only his family and his cat, Alfador. When Lavos is encountered in 12,000 B.C., Janus is swept up in temporal distortion and warped to the year 600 A.D.<br /><br />Here, he allied himself with the Mystics, and became their ruler. It was here that he changed his name to Magus. Despite this, he retained the goal to defeat Lavos and find his sister Schala (which remains his singular goal for the larger part of the series). Magus is responsible for killing one of Guardia's top soldiers, Cyrus, and transforming Glenn into Frog.<br /><br />In Radical Dreamers, Magus one of the three main characters, however he has since changed his name to Magil (or Gil). Magil has discovered how Schala was merged with Lavos. After saving Kid from an ill-conceived revenge attempt on Lynx, he continued to travel with her, and eventually Serge as well. During the final battle with Lynx, Magil saves Kid after she uses the Chrono Trigger and learns of her past as Schala.<br /><br /><h3>Serge   </h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11847/525739-2400.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-525739\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.75862068965517\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.9%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11847/525739-2400.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-525739\"><img alt=\"\u00a0Serge, the main character of Radical Dreamers and Chrono Cross.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 261px) 100vw, 261px\" data-width=\"261\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/11847/525739-2400.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/11847/525739-2400.jpg 261w\"><noscript><img alt=\"\u00a0Serge, the main character of Radical Dreamers and Chrono Cross.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/11847/525739-2400.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/11847/525739-2400.jpg 261w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 261px) 100vw, 261px\" data-width=\"261\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0Serge, the main character of Radical Dreamers and Chrono Cross.</figcaption></figure><br /><a data-ref-id=\"3005-1766\" href=\"/serge/3005-1766/\">                       Serge</a> is a main character in both Radical Dreamers and Chrono Cross. Born in Arni Village, Serge was nearly killed at the age of three. In a desperate attempt to heal him, his father brought him to the Frozen Flame. This designated Serge as the Arbiter, and made the artifact unusable to the supercomputer FATE. Enraged, FATE was able to corrupt both Miguel (a friend of Serge's father) and Serge's father, Wazuki. This caused Wazuki to later become Lynx, a major villain in the franchise.<br /><br />In 1010 A.D., Wazuki nearly succeeded in killing Crono, although Kid came back in time to stop him. Due to this series of events, Wazuki's transformation into Lynx was complete, and he was called by FATE to the futuristic city of Chronopolis. Also as a result of Kid's time travel, she split the world into two dimensions; one where Serge lives, and one where Serge dies.<br /><br />In Radical Dreamers, Serge is a traveling musician who joins Kid and Magil in a search for the Frozen Flame. During this adventure, he falls in love with Kid (the character's actions determine whether or not she returns these feelings). During Radical Dreamers, he is only able to perform basic magic, but he always keeps his trusty knife on himself. In the final battle, he is thrust into an alternate dimension when the Chrono Trigger shatters, although he is shortly returned to the real world.<br /><br /><h3>Kid   </h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15777/457990-chrono20cross20kid.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-457990\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15777/457990-chrono20cross20kid.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-457990\"><img alt=\"\u00a0Kid is a clone of Schala\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/15777/457990-chrono20cross20kid.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/15777/457990-chrono20cross20kid.jpg 1024w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1/15777/457990-chrono20cross20kid.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/15777/457990-chrono20cross20kid.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/15777/457990-chrono20cross20kid.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"\u00a0Kid is a clone of Schala\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/15777/457990-chrono20cross20kid.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/15777/457990-chrono20cross20kid.jpg 1024w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1/15777/457990-chrono20cross20kid.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/15777/457990-chrono20cross20kid.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/15777/457990-chrono20cross20kid.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0Kid is a clone of Schala</figcaption></figure><br />The clone of Schala who was sent to the modern world, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1591\" href=\"/kid/3005-1591/\">                      Kid</a> was raised by Lucca in her orphanage. It was here that Kid was given a Time Egg and an Astral Amulet, both of which she later uses in her adventures. In 1015 A.D., when Lynx murdered Lucca, Kid began to sought up revenge by forming the raiding group, Radical Dreamers.<br /><br />Although initially only containing herself, she was later joined by Magil and Serge. Together, they travel to the Viper Manor in search of the Frozen Flame. It is possible for Kid to fall in love with Serge (the player character), although there are a variety of factors determining this. It is during the final battle with Lynx that she shatters the Time Egg, and her true origins as Schala are revealed.<br /><br />Kid's timeline after 1015 A.D. is slightly complicated. It is speculated that Belthasar had to have contacted her sometime after 1015 A.D., instructing her to save Serge in 1010 A.D. This singular act caused the dimensions to split, and led to many of the events of Chrono Cross. She plays a major role for almost all of Chrono Cross, and in the final scenes of the game, it is hinted that she marries Serge.<br /><br /><h3>Lynx   </h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15777/457910-ccwp14_800_.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-457910\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15777/457910-ccwp14_800_.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-457910\"><img alt=\"\u00a0Lynx, a servant of the supercomputer FATE\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/15777/457910-ccwp14_800_.gif\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/15777/457910-ccwp14_800_.gif 800w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/15777/457910-ccwp14_800_.gif 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/15777/457910-ccwp14_800_.gif 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"\u00a0Lynx, a servant of the supercomputer FATE\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/15777/457910-ccwp14_800_.gif\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/15777/457910-ccwp14_800_.gif 800w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/15777/457910-ccwp14_800_.gif 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/15777/457910-ccwp14_800_.gif 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0Lynx, a servant of the supercomputer FATE</figcaption></figure><br />A major <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1104\" href=\"/villain/3015-1104/\"> villain</a> in both Radical Dreamers and Chrono Cross, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-5116\" href=\"/lynx/3005-5116/\">                     Lynx</a> is a cat-like servant of the supercomputer known as FATE. Although he was previously Wazuki, father of Serge, his contact with the Frozen Flame corrupted him, and he became a willing servant of FATE. After attempting to murder Serge in 1010 A.D., and failing, Wazuki left to Chronopolis, the home of FATE. It was there that he finished his transformation into Lynx.<br /><br />After this, he carries out FATE's orders, attempting to restore the control of the Frozen Flame to FATE. In 1015 A.D., he murders Lucca, who helped create the Prometheus Circuit, which was locking FATE out of using the Frozen Flame. When Serge traveled across the split dimensions, he found Lynx, who used the Dragon Tear to switch bodies with him. After Serge managed to restore his body, Lynx hid until their final confrontation, where Lynx met his end.<br /><br />In Radical Dreamers, Kid, Serge, and Magil are searching for the Frozen Flame in Viper Manor, which is owned by Lynx. It is here that they learn of Kid's past as Schala. After Viper Manor is stormed by the army of Porre, Lynx escapes and flees into the night, not seen again until Chrono Cross.<br /><br /><h3>FATE   </h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1316237-fate.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1316237\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.76029962546816\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:76.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1316237-fate.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1316237\"><img alt=\"\u00a0FATE plays a role in Project Kid\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 267px) 100vw, 267px\" data-width=\"267\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/1316237-fate.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/1316237-fate.jpg 267w\"><noscript><img alt=\"\u00a0FATE plays a role in Project Kid\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/1316237-fate.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/1316237-fate.jpg 267w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 267px) 100vw, 267px\" data-width=\"267\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0FATE plays a role in Project Kid</figcaption></figure><br />A supercomputer which Belthasar uses in Project Kid, FATE serves as a mediator for many of the events in Chrono Cross. FATE is responsible for corrupting Wazuki into Lynx, many attempts on Serge's life, and the creation of the island paradise, El Nido. When Chronopolis was sent to the past, and Dinopolis sent to the same time, FATE captured the Dragon God and split it into six Elements. He proceeded to take the inhabitants of Chronopolis, erase their memories, and send them to a newly created island paradise, El Nido.<br /><br />When Serge became Arbiter of the Frozen Flame in 1006 A.D., FATE was locked out of its usage. Now unable to use the Frozen Flame due to the Prometheus Circuit, FATE sought after unlocking the Frozen Flame. Initially, he tried to kill Serge, but when that failed he waited until the boy traveled between split dimensions. In 1015 A.D., FATE was also responsible for murdering Lucca, the creator of the Prometheus Circuit.<br /><br />Possibly as a necessary part of Project Kid, FATE was defeated when Serge made it to Chronopolis. When FATE was killed, his hold on the Dragons subsided, and they managed to steal the Frozen Flame, becoming the Dragon God (and the primary villain for a time in Chrono Cross). FATE's true intentions are never incredibly clear. There are parts of the game where it seems that FATE contradicts Belthasar's programming, and yet other times where FATE seems to display emotion.<br /><br /><h3>Lavos   </h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10967/1097395-lavos2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1097395\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10967/1097395-lavos2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1097395\"><img alt=\"The inside of Lavos' shell\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/10967/1097395-lavos2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/10967/1097395-lavos2.jpg 472w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/10967/1097395-lavos2.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The inside of Lavos' shell\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/10967/1097395-lavos2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/10967/1097395-lavos2.jpg 472w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/10967/1097395-lavos2.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The inside of Lavos' shell</figcaption></figure><br />The main antagonist for the majority of the franchise, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2278\" href=\"/lavos/3005-2278/\">                    Lavos</a> initially came to the planet in 65,000,000 B.C.

When Crono's team discovers this, they vow to stop Lavos.<br /><br />In the events of Chrono Trigger, they manage to stop Lavos by defeating him, banishing him to the Darkness Beyond Time. It was here that Schala ended up after her grief became too much for her and the Frozen Flame teleported her there. Schala and Lavos merged to form the Time Devourer, although an alternate event in Chrono Trigger DS allude to a previous version, the Dream Devourer, that Magus attempts to face.<br /><br />In Chrono Cross, Lavos has completed his transformation into the Time Devourer. Belthasar creates Project Kid, a massive temporal project involving a wide variety of factors in which he plans to make Serge powerful enough to free Schala and defeat the Time Devourer.

Possessing incredible magical abilities, Schala is forced by her mother to power the Mammon Machine, which is being used to harness Lavos' power. Due to this, Schala suffers from incredible guilt and grief from the pain that she caused by forcing Lavos to emerge in 12,000 B.C.<br /><br />After the events of Chrono Trigger, Schala is sent to the Darkness Beyond Time. Here, at an unknown time and by an unknown origin, Schala is able to send a clone of herself to the future in a brief moment of lucidity, fearing that she is losing herself to Lavos. The clone, Kid, plays a major role in both Radical Dreamers and Chrono Cross.<br /><br />During Chrono Cross, Belthasar forms Project Kid, which has the singular goal of freeing Schala. This plan succeeds, and Schala thanks Serge in the final moments of the game, stating that he will not be able to remember anything after he is sent back to his home.

Despite the fact that he contracted stomach ulcers and had a hard drive crash losing much of his work (prompting Nobuo Uematsu to step in), he composed many of the songs in Chrono Trigger. A variety of compilations of the music were released, including a recent promotional soundtrack included with the DS release of Chrono Trigger.<br /><br />Yasunori Mitsuda continued to compose the music for Radical Dreamers. Despite never being commercially released in album form, Radical Dreamers' music was accessible in a hidden sound test in one of the game's many extra modes. Although the songs were never officially named, the fan translation gave them names based off of the naming conventions in Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross (e.g. Far Promise ~ Dream Shore).<br /><br />The same composer, Yasunori Mitsuda, returned to compose a 65 track soundtrack for Chrono Cross. The music of Chrono Cross differs from other games in the franchise, taking many of the themes found in the songs from older music, such as Mediterranean, Celtic, or African music. The expansive soundtrack featured many other artists as well, including <a data-ref-id=\"3040-95264\" href=\"/tomohiko-kira/3040-95264/\">                                                Tomohiko Kira</a> (who plays guitar in many of the songs) and <a data-ref-id=\"3040-95272\" href=\"/noriko-mitose/3040-95272/\">                                               Noriko Mitose</a> (who sings vocals in one song--Radical Dreamers ~ Le Tr\u00e9sor Interdit). In addition, the Chrono Cross soundtrack features a wide variety of motifs found in previous games, including remastered Radical Dreamers songs and short clips from several Chrono Trigger songs.<br /><br /><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Anime   </h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/779129-ctanime_shot01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-779129\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.58679706601467\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:58.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/779129-ctanime_shot01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-779129\"><img alt=\"\u00a0The anime stars a Nu and a Kilwala.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/779129-ctanime_shot01.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/779129-ctanime_shot01.jpg 409w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/779129-ctanime_shot01.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"\u00a0The anime stars a Nu and a Kilwala.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/779129-ctanime_shot01.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/779129-ctanime_shot01.jpg 409w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/779129-ctanime_shot01.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0The anime stars a Nu and a Kilwala.</figcaption></figure>   \u00a0  <br />The only anime created based on the Chrono franchise, Time and Space Adventures: Nuumamonjaa is a 16-minute anime short which premiered on July 31, 1996 at a V-Jump Festival.

This concept hit a brick wall with the hardcore SOCOM fans as they found vehicles to have changed the tactical, slow-paced gameplay of SOCOM. Many began condemning the developer, Zipper Interactive, and asked for the next sequel to be more intimite, and close-quarters, than an open battle which SOCOM 3 was described to be.

Just prior to going offline, she informs Durandal of her plans to defeat the Pfhor, and Durandal himself takes over the task of directing the player from this point, as helping the security officer repel the attack will further his own goal of leaving the Marathon.

Through communications with the player it becomes evident that Durandal believes Lh'owon to be the resting place of an ancient technology that holds the key to defeating the Pfhor. After searching several sites on Lh'owon for evidence of the fate of the ancient S'pht and any secrets they may have possessed, the player character is suddenly called back to the Sfiera after the arrival of the Pfhor's Battle Group Seven, accompanied by Tycho, who has been repurposed to serve the Pfhor.</p><p>Despite the humans' best efforts to defend the ship, the Sfiera is eventually overwhelmed by Battle Group Seven, and Durandal orders the security officer to destroy his logic centers in order to prevent his capture.

With the humans fighting a losing battle, the security officer continues to search for the lost technology Durandal spoke of, eventually activating an ancient and cryptic A.I. known as Thoth. Thoth summons the eleventh S'pht clan, the highly advanced S'pht'Kr, who immediately attack the Pfhor responsible for enslaving their brethren. Around the same time, Durandal reemerges unexpectedly after forcing Tycho's ship into one of the moons of Lh'owon. Realizing their defeat, the enraged Pfhor activate the trih xeem device, causing Lh'owon's sun to go into early nova and forcing both sides to leave the system.</p><h3>Marathon Infinity</h3><p>The meaning of many events within Marathon Infinity's campaign, entitled \"Blood Tides of Lh'owon,\" are open to interpretation, however it is clear that the very fabric of the universe has become threatened by the trih xeem device employed by the Pfhor in Marathon 2. Evidently, Lh'owon's sun acted as a prison for a being of pure chaos called the W''rkncacnter, and by activating the trih xeem the Pfhor unwittingly set it free. As the game begins, the normally sardonic Durandal is uncharacteristically shaken by the revelation of the W'rkncacnter's existence, and seems to fear the growing chaos that approaches. Exactly what happens after this point is a matter of some speculation, but it is clear that the player is being made to experience the previous game's battle for Lh'owon from different vantage points, in some cases even aiding Tycho and the Pfhor while battling Durandal and his human captives.</p><p>How the player is able to experience these alternate realities is not entirely clear. Some theories point to the influence of the W'rkncacnter, others to possible Jjaro technology, and others still claim that these events are dreams rather than literal happenings. Whatever the truth of the matter may be, it can be inferred that the purpose of these excursions is to find a means to prevent the all-consuming chaos of the W'rkncacnter from engulfing the known universe. Central to this is an ancient Jjaro station that the player can travel to on multiple occasions, though only on the player's final trip can it actually be activated. This act seemingly contains the nigh-unstoppable W'rkncacnter, though the game's epilogue does not explicitly spell out what happens in the aftermath of this event, instead giving the player the liberty to interpret the full meaning of much of the game's narrative on their own.</p><h3>Fan Interpretation</h3><p>Marathon's story is told primarily through computer terminal messages, and some of the finer points of its plot are left intentionally vague, leading many players to speculate about details lying below the surface. These attempts to decipher Marathon's fiction take the form of everything from discussions of the game's main character and whether or not he is a cyborg, to interpretations of some of the more obtuse terminal messages. On September 19, 1995, the <a href=\"http://marathon.bungie.org/story/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Marathon's Story</a> site was born specifically to collect various fan theories and provide a formal venue for Marathon players to debate the series' fiction. Created and maintained by Hamish Sinclair, the Marathon's Story page eventually became a well-respected institution within the Marathon community, and new musings and discussions regarding Marathon's narrative still take place there more than fifteen years after the last Marathon game was released.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Single-Player</h3><p>The basic gameplay and structure of Marathon's single-player scenarios is very similar to that of other early first-person shooters. The player progresses through a linear series of levels, gaining new weapons and fighting progressively tougher enemies along the way. In many situations the player may also be required to solve environmental challenges in order to progress, which might take the form of <a data-ref-id=\"3055-2026\" href=\"/switch/3055-2026/\" slug=\"switch\">switch</a> puzzles, <a data-ref-id=\"3055-1179\" href=\"/platform/3055-1179/\" slug=\"platform\">platform</a> traversal, and the like. Missions typically require certain objectives be completed before the player can progress, rather than simply finding a predetermined exit point. A player might, for instance, be tasked with killing certain enemies within the level before they can proceed, finding and retrieving a certain object or objects, or defending specified targets. These objectives are communicated to the player by way of in-game computer terminals, which also serve to convey the series' story, and once all objectives within a level are complete, the player can be teleported via terminal to the next level in the sequence. The final game, Marathon Infinity, changes the structure of the campaign slightly by allowing the player to jump ahead to later levels or travel back to earlier levels in the campaign at certain points, though the content of the missions themselves is very much consistent with earlier games.</p><p>Throughout the games, the player is required to monitor <a data-ref-id=\"3015-130\" href=\"/health/3015-130/\" slug=\"health\">health</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3055-533\" href=\"/ammo/3055-533/\" slug=\"ammo\">ammunition</a> levels. While later games in the series introduced <a data-ref-id=\"3055-255\" href=\"/health-pack/3055-255/\" slug=\"health-pack\">health pickups</a>, vitality is primarily restored through preset <a data-ref-id=\"3055-3887\" href=\"/health-station/3055-3887/\" slug=\"health-station\">health stations</a> found within the environment, which can be used multiple times. The player's health is not displayed numerically, but rather as a single depleting health bar with different colors denoting how much vitality the player has. With one bar or less of vitality the player's existing health is shown in red; filling the gauge past the first bar will begin to change the bar from red to yellow, indicating a second charge, and gaining health in excess of two bars will gradually change the bar from yellow to purple, denoting a third and final level of health. Weapon ammunition is found scattered throughout the levels, and aside from the game's highest difficulty level, which gives the player unlimited carrying capacity, a finite amount can be carried for each type. Marathon also features a reload mechanic, and although it is not possible to manually reload, the remaining ammunition in the currently equipped weapon is displayed in the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-180\" href=\"/heads-up-display/3015-180/\" slug=\"heads-up-display\">HUD</a> at all times so that the player can avoid reloads at inopportune times.</p><p>The Marathon series also forces players on occasion to take into account their oxygen supply and environmental physics. In the first game, oxygen considerations are restricted to instances where the player is in a vacuum environment. When in these conditions, the oxygen meter slowly diminishes, eventually resulting in the player's death if it is not periodically replenished. Much like health, the oxygen gauge is restored either through fixed wall stations within a level or through <a data-ref-id=\"3055-3607\" href=\"/oxygen-tank/3055-3607/\" slug=\"oxygen-tank\">oxygen tank</a> pickups. From Marathon 2 onward, the player can also become fully submerged in liquid substances, which not only drains oxygen, but also in the case of hazardous liquids causes damage to the player. Marathon furthermore incorporates a physics engine which impacts several areas of play. The force of certain weapons, for instance, can be used to propel the player off of the ground, certain maps introduce altered gravity levels, and bypassing some obstacles requires the player to demonstrate a basic understanding of their avatar's rate of descent.</p><p>Another unique feature of the Marathon series is its motion sensor, which gives players the means to detect hostile and friendly targets outside of their visual range while also allowing them to ascertain their own detectability. Friendly targets on the motion sensor are visualized as green squares, while hostiles or unknowns are highlighted as red triangles; in multiplayer, network opponents are displayed as yellow squares. The player will appear as a green square at the center of the motion detector if their own movements render them detectable to motion sensor equipment. In some multiplayer modes, the motion sensor is also used to indicate the position of mode-specific targets such as \"the guy with the ball\" or the hill in King of the Hill mode. Within the campaign, though, it is used primarily for enemy detection purposes. Certain environments, such as the bowels of a Pfhor vessel, may inhibit the motion detector from functioning properly.</p><h3>Multiplayer</h3><p>Although the original Marathon shipped with only the ability to play <a data-ref-id=\"3015-451\" href=\"/deathmatch/3015-451/\" slug=\"deathmatch\">deathmatch</a> (called Every Man for Himself) and team deathmatch modes, the release of Marathon 2 greatly expanded the number of available modes. This includes the ability to play through the game's campaign cooperatively, which was a feature Bungie had meant to include in the original game, as well as new competitive modes like Kill the Man with the Ball, King of the Hill, and Tag. Each iteration of Marathon was released with several unique maps created specifically for these competitive multiplayer modes, and many details could be customized, such as player and team colors, death and suicide penalties, time and kill limits, and whether or not players have the ability to use the motion detector. Marathon multiplayer also supported in-game voice chat during multiplayer, a relatively uncommon feature when the game was introduced in 1994. It is still possible to play Marathon multiplayer relatively painlessly at present through the Aleph One <a data-ref-id=\"3015-4367\" href=\"/source-port/3015-4367/\" slug=\"source-port\">source port</a> and <a href=\"http://www.mariusnet.com/\" rel=\"nofollow \">MaruisNet</a>, a fan-made matchmaking server for Bungie's <a data-ref-id=\"3025-521\" href=\"/myth/3025-521/\" slug=\"myth\">Myth series</a> which was eventually expanded to include Marathon.</p><h2>Games</h2><table class=\"t-editor full-width\"><tbody><tr><td><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2192548-marathon_logo.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2192548\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.62114537444934\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.1%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2192548-marathon_logo.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2192548\"><img alt=\"Marathon\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/2192548-marathon_logo.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/11/118253/2192548-marathon_logo.png 454w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/2192548-marathon_logo.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Marathon</figcaption></figure></td><td><h3><a data-ref-id=\"3030-20232\" href=\"/marathon/3030-20232/\" slug=\"marathon\">Marathon</a> (1994)</h3>Released in late 1994, Marathon received a significant amount of praise from the Macintosh gaming community upon its release, and according to Bungie its sales numbers ranked in the hundreds of thousands. It is frequently cited as one of the first FPS titles to include features such as <a data-ref-id=\"3015-135\" href=\"/dual-wielding/3015-135/\" slug=\"dual-wielding\">dual-wielding</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3015-593\" href=\"/alternate-fire/3015-593/\" slug=\"alternate-fire\">alternate firing modes</a>, and multiplayer <a data-ref-id=\"3015-648\" href=\"/voice-chat/3015-648/\" slug=\"voice-chat\">voice chat</a>.

Though the overall features and presentation would be expanded in later iterations, Marathon is notable for being the only game in the franchise to feature ambient background music, which was replaced by environmental sounds in later games.</td></tr><tr><td><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2192545-marathon_2_logo.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2192545\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.62114537444934\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.1%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2192545-marathon_2_logo.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2192545\"><img alt=\"Marathon 2\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/2192545-marathon_2_logo.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/11/118253/2192545-marathon_2_logo.png 454w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/2192545-marathon_2_logo.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Marathon 2</figcaption></figure></td><td><h3><a data-ref-id=\"3030-1921\" href=\"/marathon-2-durandal/3030-1921/\" slug=\"marathon-2-durandal\">Marathon 2: Durandal</a> (1995)</h3>Advancements in the Marathon engine led to a large number of noticeable changes in Marathon 2, such as an expanded field of view, a greater emphasis on outdoor environments, and the incorporation of liquids that the player could be submerged in. With a few exceptions, the play mechanics of the original Marathon are largely intact. Although it features only one new weapon, and roughly half of its enemies are returning foes from the first game, none of the art assets for weapons or enemies are reused, instead being completely redrawn for the sequel. Marathon 2 saw the advent of several new multiplayer modes, such as Coop, King of the Hill, and Kill the Man with the Ball, which were accompanied by thirteen new network levels.</td></tr><tr><td><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2192546-marathon_infinity_logo.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2192546\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.62114537444934\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.1%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2192546-marathon_infinity_logo.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2192546\"><img alt=\"Marathon Infinity\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/2192546-marathon_infinity_logo.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/11/118253/2192546-marathon_infinity_logo.png 454w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/2192546-marathon_infinity_logo.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Marathon Infinity\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/2192546-marathon_infinity_logo.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/11/118253/2192546-marathon_infinity_logo.png 454w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/2192546-marathon_infinity_logo.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Marathon Infinity</figcaption></figure></td><td><h3><a data-ref-id=\"3030-20018\" href=\"/marathon-infinity/3030-20018/\" slug=\"marathon-infinity\">Marathon Infinity</a> (1996)</h3>The final chapter of the Marathon Trilogy was initially envisioned simply as a means to deliver Bungie's editing tools, Forge and Anvil, to the player community, though it eventually grew to include a new campaign and a slew of new net maps. Often seen as the hardest of the Marathon titles to penetrate from a narrative perspective, Infinity was an exercise, according to series writer <a data-ref-id=\"3040-14715\" href=\"/greg-kirkpatrick/3040-14715/\" slug=\"greg-kirkpatrick\">Greg Kirkpatrick</a>, aimed at creating a plotline that was deliberately complex and difficult to follow. So named because of Bungie's desire to foster continued growth and longevity in the Marathon community, Infinity was seemingly successful in this regard, as its editing tools led to a large number of fan-created maps and scenarios that continue to be released over fifteen years later.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Other Releases</h2><h3>Ports</h3><p>The Marathon games were not ported to a large number of systems at the time of their release, though Marathon 2 found its way to the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-94\" href=\"/pc/3045-94/\" slug=\"pc\">PC</a> in 1996 as a direct port by Bungie. In the same year, Marathon 2 and its predecessor were released together for the ill-fated <a data-ref-id=\"3045-102\" href=\"/pippin/3045-102/\" slug=\"pippin\">Apple Pippin</a> as <a data-ref-id=\"3030-21648\" href=\"/super-marathon/3030-21648/\" slug=\"super-marathon\">Super Marathon</a>. More than a decade later, Marathon 2 was ported again, this time to <a data-ref-id=\"3045-86\" href=\"/xbox-live-marketplace/3045-86/\" slug=\"xbox-live-marketplace\">Xbox Live Arcade</a>, where it was renamed simply Marathon: Durandal. This project was managed by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1689\" href=\"/freeverse-inc/3010-1689/\" slug=\"freeverse-inc\">Freeverse</a> rather than Bungie itself, and actually ran on a new engine which boasted sixty frames per second (over the original's thirty), new HD texture created specifically for the rerelease, and a new single-player Survival mode. Unfortunatley, this release was marred by reports of motion sickness caused by the engine's high framerate, forcing Freeverse to release a later patch intended to address the problem. More recently, ports of Marathon and Marathon 2 have also been released for <a data-ref-id=\"3045-96\" href=\"/iphone/3045-96/\" slug=\"iphone\">iOS</a> as free downloads, both of which were personal projects spearheaded by Marathon fan Daniel Blezek.</p><h3>Aleph One</h3><p>Following the source code release of the Marathon 2 engine in 2000, the open source <a href=\"http://source.bungie.org/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Aleph One</a> project was created to develop a stable Marathon engine for modern computer systems. Some twelve years after the original source code release, Aleph One reached version 1.0 in late 2011, and due to the freeware release of the entire trilogy in 2005, Aleph One versions of all three games, as well as a number of other fan creations, can be freely downloaded from the project's main website, which run natively on Macintosh, Windows, and Linux operating systems.

This is then followed by a series of gameplay sequences set to a particular song with brief cutscenes at break points used to rate the player's progress. The player must keep in rhythm with the song by interacting with three kinds of markers.</p><h3>Hit Markers</h3><p>These are numbered circles that appear on screen that must be tapped with the stylus in the proper order. Colored halos shrink around each one. To stay close to the beat, the player must tap the marker when the halo overlaps its edge.</p><h3>Phrase Markers</h3><p>These are Hit Markers with tracks that extend outward from them. When tapped, the player must trace the stylus along the track in time with a rolling ball. If an arrow is at the other end of the track, the player must run the stylus back over the track in the other direction. It's not uncommon for Phrase Markers to require sliding the stylus back and forth several times.</p><h3>Spin Markers</h3><p>The rarest kind of marker, it is most commonly seen at the end of each song or just before a song's break point. When it appears, the player must simply use the stylus to spin a colored wheel as quickly as possible in order to fill up a gauge along the side of the screen. Spinning the marker fast enough can earn hefty amounts of bonus points.</p><h2>Difficulty Modes</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14097/762854-74.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-762854\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4848484848485\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:148.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14097/762854-74.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-762854\"><img alt=\"Sumo wrestler in need of training?

Not a problem for these guys.</figcaption></figure><p>Each game in the franchise has four levels of difficulty. The names of the difficulty levels depend on the game, but correspond to Easy, Normal, Hard, and Insane. The difficulty level adjusts the number of markers that appear on screen and the speed with which they must be hit. The track patterns seen in Insane Mode are the mirrored forms of those seen in Hard Mode with some tweaks, but also shrink the size of the markers and leave them on screen for much shorter periods of time, making them much more difficult to hit. The difficulty level also affects which Ouendan/EBA squad the player controls. On the hardest difficulty setting, the male characters are replaced with a female cheer squad.</p><h2>Music Variety</h2><p>The Ouendan franchise typically features pop music from a diverse span of eras, ranging from recent hits to songs dating back to the 1970s. Most of the songs in the series are covers, though the original Ouendan and Ouendan 2 both feature at least one song that uses the original recording.</p><h2>Series Influence</h2><p>The gameplay in the Ouendan franchise has gone on to influence the direction of development for other DS games as well. The DS version of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-3821\" href=\"/happy-feet/3030-3821/\" slug=\"happy-feet\">Happy Feet</a>, for instance, uses a very simple form of Ouendan-style gameplay that focuses only on Hit Markers, while <a data-ref-id=\"3030-5613\" href=\"/assassins-creed-altairs-chronicles/3030-5613/\" slug=\"assassins-creed-altairs-chronicles\">Assassin's Creed: Altair's Chronicles</a> adapts the gameplay mechanics to work outside the context of a music/rhythm game.</p>", "guid": "3025-635", "name": "Ouendan"}, {"description": "<p>While each of the three Golden Suns have different stories, the overall story follows a group of Psynergy-wielding-Adepts on the quest to save the world. These quests are intimately tied in with Alchemy.\u00a0<br />\u00a0</p><h2>Golden Sun</h2><a data-ref-id=\"3005-3430\" href=\"/isaac/3005-3430/\">Isaac</a>\u00a0is the main character of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-267\" href=\"/golden-sun/3030-267/\">Golden Sun</a>. In the prologue that\u00a0occurred\u00a0three years before the game, a boulder rolled down from the top of Mt. Aleph towards the small town of Vale. The town vastly survived the incident, but Isaac's father, as well as the parents and brother of his \u00a0friend Jenna, disappeared after the incident and were thought dead. Feeling as if he could have protected his father, Isaac takes up the study of <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3257\" href=\"/psynergy/3015-3257/\">Psynergy</a>, in order to become stronger.\u00a0\u00a0<br />\u00a0<br />Three years later, when his friends Jenna and the scholar Kraden were kidnapped, and the sacred treasures of the Sol Sanctum, the Elemental Stars, were stolen, he and his best friend <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3431\" href=\"/garet/3005-3431/\">Garet</a>\u00a0are thrust into a quest to stop the Elemental Lighthouses from being lit. The Wise One, eye-shaped, god-like protector of the Sol Sanctum, revealed to Isaac and Garet that the Stars would light the Lighthouses, and by lighting the Lighthouses, Alchemy would be restored to the world, dooming mankind. Entrusting the only Elemental Star that was not stolen, the Mars Star, to Isaac and Garet, the Wise One set their quest in motion.\u00a0\u00a0<br />\u00a0<br />With this burden, Venus Adept Isaac and Mars Adept Garet set out to intercept the thieving <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3428\" href=\"/saturos/3005-3428/\">Saturos</a>,\u00a0<a data-ref-id=\"3005-3429\" href=\"/menardi/3005-3429/\">Menardi</a>, Jenna's traitorous brother <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3616\" href=\"/felix/3005-3616/\">Felix</a>\u00a0(also a Venus Adept), and the mysterious Mercury Adept <a data-ref-id=\"3005-12423\" href=\"/alex/3005-12423/\">Alex</a>. Along the way, Isaac and Garet are joined by the Jupiter Adept <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3432\" href=\"/ivan/3005-3432/\">Ivan</a> and the Mercury Adept <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3433\" href=\"/mia/3005-3433/\">Mia</a>. However, they were unable to prevent the lighting of the Mercury Lighthouse or the Venus Lighthouse.\u00a0However, Isaac's party managed to fell Saturos and Menardi at the conclusion of the first game.\u00a0<br />\u00a0<h2>Golden Sun: The Lost Age</h2><a data-ref-id=\"3005-3616\" href=\"/felix/3005-3616/\">Felix</a> is the main character of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-4277\" href=\"/golden-sun-the-lost-age/3030-4277/\">Golden Sun: The Lost Age</a>. Starting at the end of Golden Sun, Felix, Jenna, the Jupiter Adept <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3626\" href=\"/sheba/3005-3626/\">Sheba</a> (also kidnapped by Sarturos' group), Alex, and Kraden were stranded on an island after the Venus Lighthouse was lit, and, due to the resulting earthquakes, drifted to the other side of the world. After gaining their bearings, recruiting the Mercury Adept <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3627\" href=\"/piers/3005-3627/\">Piers</a>, and obtaining a ship, it is revealed that Alchemy is necessary to the world of <a data-ref-id=\"3035-2189\" href=\"/weyard/3035-2189/\">Weyard</a>. \u00a0When the ancients had sealed up Alchemy, they stopped people from abusing it, but as Alchemy held the world together, they cursed the world with a slow death. Because of that slow death, the town of Prox, Sarturos and Menardi's hometown, was drifting towards the edge of the flat world.\u00a0\u00a0<br />\u00a0<br />Making haste, Felix's party made its way to the Jupiter Lighthouse. There, they saw Isaac's party under attack by <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3823\" href=\"/agatio/3005-3823/\">Agatio</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3819\" href=\"/karst/3005-3819/\">Karst</a>. Also from the far-off town of Prox, Karst wanted to defeat Isaac, Garet, Ivan, and Mia, because they killed her sister, Menardi. Surprisingly, Felix came to Isaac's rescue, but the Jupiter Lighthouse was lit. Furthermore, Karst and Agatio had stolen the Mars Star from Isaac.\u00a0<br />\u00a0<br />Retreating to the nearby town of Contigo, Isaac and his friends confront Felix, and learn the truth about Alchemy. After absorbing what Felix, Jenna, Sheba, Piers, and Kraden claimed, Isaac accepted the necessity of Alchemy, and joined Felix and his party on their quest. As such, their next destination was the Mars Lighthouse, which was completely frozen over. While attempting to re-heat the tower, the party fought two Flame Dragons, which turned out to be a horribly mutated form of Agatio and Karst. In their dying breaths, they said that \"the eye\" deemed them lacking the will to proceed. Before they passed away, the two entrusted the Mars Star to Felix, asking him to complete the job.\u00a0<br />\u00a0<br />Making their way to the top of the Lighthouse, Felix, Isaac, and the rest of the Warriors are confronted by none other than the Wise One. The Wise One chastises Isaac and Garet for not heeding his orders and assisting in the return of Alchemy. When the group reveals what they have learned, the Wise One notes how they have been played for fools. In reality, Alex, the Mercury Adept who had assisted Saturos, Menardi, Karst, Agatio, and Felix, knew more than they did. Once the final Lighthouse was lit and Alchemy was restored to the world, the power would converge in a \"Golden Sun\" at the top of Mt. Aleph. Alex was approaching the top to absorb this power.\u00a0\u00a0<br />\u00a0<br />Though shocked, the group of Adepts maintained their resolve, and cited something the Wise One had said: He was unable to interfere with them directly. The Wise One noted this, but causes a \"miracle\" to happen, and summons a Three-Headed Dragon. In their most fearsome battle, the Adepts defeated the beast. At the conclusion, however, they had really slain Isaac's father and Jenna and Felix's parents. After the incident at Mt. Aleph, they were not dead, but rather, found by Sarturos and Menardi and imprisoned in Prox. Sad, but maintaining their resolve, the group threw the last Star into the Lighthouse and restored Alchemy.\u00a0<br />\u00a0<br />However, the Wise One never intended for their parents to die - the rush of energy that emerged from the Mars Lighthouse revitalized their parents, and restored their lives. Happily, the group returns to Vale, only to find it completely destroyed by the Golden Sun. But no one had died. The Wise One informed the citizens of Vale about how the Golden Sun would destroy their homes, and they fled. With everyone alive, the Adepts, later called \"The Warriors of Vale,\" lived with their loved ones.\u00a0<br />\u00a0<h2>Golden Sun: Dark Dawn</h2>Rather unfortunately, Alchemy stopped the world from a slow death, but caused numerous natural disasters.

Having left his graduation project only partly complete when Nick Park joined the Aardman Animations, the studio picked up the characters and helped Park complete his work, which would finally become Wallace and Gromit's first TV film, <i>A Grand Day Out</i>. Wallace, voiced by the English actor Peter Sallis, is an absent minded, cheese loving eccentric inventor from Wigan who lives alone with his Dog, Gromit. Although Gromit is a <a href=\"/silent-protagonist/3015-54/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-54\">Slient Protagonist</a>, his strong and overtly animated facial expressions, paired with his anthropomorphic body language give the audience a vague idea of what he is thinking, often to the point that many people just assume that he is a talking Dog. </p><p>After <i>A Grand Day Out</i> was met with both critical and popular acclaim upon it's debut in 1989, Wallace and Gromit went on to star in a further 3 TV specials - <i>The Wrong Trouser</i>s<i>, A Close Shave</i> and <i>A Matter of Loaf and Death</i>, - as well as appearing in several series of shorts (collectively called <i>Wallace &amp; Gromit's Cracking Contraptions</i>) as well as a full length motion picture called <i>Curse of the Were Rabbit</i>.

The main complaints were primitive graphics, consisting of coloured text on a background image, and match engine, which comprised of a clock, a meter showing each teams possession, and lines of text describing the action. The lack of licensed players was also a hindrance. These issues were all addressed in the follow up, <em>Championship Manager '93</em>, which was a much bigger hit for critics and players. It was also the first game in the series to be developed by Sports Interactive, the company set up by the Collyers to focus on <em>Championship Manager</em>. The series continued to add yearly updates, such as new leagues, updating the rules to keep up with real football (such as the Bosman rule), and a 2D match engine in Championship Manager 4.</p><h3>Move to Sega</h3><p>After <em>Championship Manager: Season 03/04</em>, Sports Interactive left publisher Eidos and signed a deal with Sega, with both parties keeping their intellectual properties: SI kept the base code, game database and programming of the game, and Eidos holding the rights to the <em>Championship Manager</em> name and interface. For legal reasons, the cause for the split has never been fully revealed, although it is theorised the Sega offered the SI team more creative freedom then they had enjoyed with Eidos. <em>Football Manager 2005 </em>was the first game of the new partnership, with the Eidos published <em>Championship Manager 5 </em>being developed by Beautiful Game Studios.</p><h3>Impact</h3><p>As of 2014, <em>Championship </em>and<em> Football Manager</em> have sold over a combined 15 millions copies worldwide, with the series being responsible for 6 of the top 10 fastest selling games PC of all time in the UK, and an accumulated 200 weeks at the top of the PC charts.</p><p>The series vast database has been used a tool for real life football clubs to scout players. In 2008, Everton signed an official deal to use the Football Manager database to search for prospective players and staff. Former Cardiff City boss Ole Gunner Solskjaer has also claimed to have used the game to prepare himself for a managerial career. In 2012, Azerbaijan student Vugar Huseynzade was even given the role of FC Baku's reserve team manager on the basis of his success in the game, reportedly beating out former French player Jean-Pierre Pain for the job.</p><p>Football Manager has become notorious for its addictiveness, with many players dreaming of taking lower league teams to Champions League glory, consuming hundreds of hours of playtime.

The first game, <a href=\"/etrian-odyssey/3030-14350/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14350\">Etrian Odyssey</a>, came out on the <a href=\"/nintendo-ds/3045-52/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-52\">Nintendo DS</a> on May 15, 2007 in America, and the latest game, <a href=\"/etrian-odyssey-v-beyond-the-myth/3030-48274/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-48274\">Etrian Odyssey V: Beyond The Myth</a>, was released on the <a href=\"/nintendo-3ds/3045-117/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-117\">Nintendo 3DS</a> Oct 17, 2017 in America.</p><h2>General Gameplay</h2><p>Center to Etrian Odyssey are its massive multi-level dungeons, known as the <a href=\"/yggdrasil-labyrinth/3035-1720/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1720\">Yggdrasil Labyrinth</a>. Players descend (or ascend) through the various strata of the Labyrinth, eventually finding out its secrets and defeating the master of the Labyrinth. The Labyrinth itself is tile-based, and the dungeon layouts are not randomly generated. Players navigate the dungeon in a first-person perspective, and each step takes a turn. There is a constant day-night cycle, and some events and enemies are time-based.</p><p>Etrian Odyssey IV shakes up the formula by introducing a full <a href=\"/overworld/3015-1004/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1004\">overworld</a> that players travel across with an <a href=\"/airship/3055-154/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-154\">airship</a>. Dungeons are now spots in the world, and are not connected with each other. There are also optional mini-dungeons to find, food to gather and cook, and special F.O.E.s to fight in the overworld.</p><h3>Cartography</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/112/1297317-26.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1297317\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/112/1297317-26.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1297317\"><img alt=\"The Map\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/112/1297317-26.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/112/1297317-26.jpg 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></a><figcaption>The Map</figcaption></figure><p>The main unique feature of the Etrian Odyssey games is its map creation. The games use the DS (and 3DS) touch screen to map out the dungeon as the player navigates it, and players can add additional icons, notes, and reminders to it at any time. The map allows players to keep track of their position and previous discoveries, without needing the use of outside tools. The map design was replicated in another Altus DS game, <a href=\"/shin-megami-tensei-strange-journey/3030-27402/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-27402\">Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey</a>, although without the creation and annotation tools.</p><p>From Etrian Odyssey III onwards, players can also add auto-pilot arrows in their maps, which, when activated, automatically moves their party in the direction the arrows point to. Players will still encounter enemies on the way, however. Millennium Girl adds a Floor Jump, which unlocks when the player has mapped most of the corresponding level.</p><h3>Combat</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1081/2241053-hb3o_yg7xfygkrkfihbvdxrq7rphzse6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2241053\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.74803149606299\" data-width=\"381\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 381px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.8%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1081/2241053-hb3o_yg7xfygkrkfihbvdxrq7rphzse6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2241053\"><img alt=\"Combat Screen\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/1081/2241053-hb3o_yg7xfygkrkfihbvdxrq7rphzse6.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/1081/2241053-hb3o_yg7xfygkrkfihbvdxrq7rphzse6.jpg 381w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/1081/2241053-hb3o_yg7xfygkrkfihbvdxrq7rphzse6.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Combat Screen\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/1081/2241053-hb3o_yg7xfygkrkfihbvdxrq7rphzse6.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/1081/2241053-hb3o_yg7xfygkrkfihbvdxrq7rphzse6.jpg 381w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/1081/2241053-hb3o_yg7xfygkrkfihbvdxrq7rphzse6.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Combat Screen</figcaption></figure><p>The Etrian Odyssey series features a traditional <a href=\"/turn-based/3015-192/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-192\">turn-based</a> menu-driven RPG combat. Encounters are somewhat random, and is determined by the proximity gauge on the bottom right corner of the top screen. Each step increases the chance of an encounter, and when the gauge turns red an encounter is imminent.</p><p>A <a href=\"/party/3015-7282/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7282\">party</a> is made up of up to 5 characters, and the player can pick between the different <a href=\"/classes/3015-405/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-405\">classes</a> available and mix them to their own desire. The party is arranged into 2 rows, the front and the rear, with a maximum of 3 characters per row. Melee weapons work better in the front row, but characters take more damage, and vice versa. When defeated, enemies will give experience points and will drop materials which can be sold to the shop for money.</p><p>Etrian Odyssey features a special type of debuff called binds. There are 3 types of binds: Head, Arm, and Leg. Every skill used, both by the player and the enemy, is associated with one of the 3 parts; head usually with magical skills, arms with physical skills, and legs with leg-based skills. Binding the associated part will disable that skill until the bind wears off. Furthermore, head binds lower accuracy and magic, arm binds lower physical attack, and leg binds lower speed and evasion. Once binded, enemies will gain additional resistance against further binds of that type.</p><p>Each Etrian Odyssey game thus far had special skills which allowed the characters to perform a special action when a bar is filled. This bar is filled by performing actions in battle, but will drop if the party runs away from battle or rests at an inn.</p><ul><li>Etrian Odyssey and its remake featured Boosts, which increased the power of the action taken by the character that turn.</li><li>Etrian Odyssey II had Force Skills, special pinch skills unique to each class. Fafnir Knight expanded on the system with Force Boosts and Breaks, which allowed you to either boost your skills or activate a powerful skill at the cost of your Force bar for the rest of that trip in the Labyrinth. Force Boosts and Breaks also return in Etrian Odyssey Nexus.</li><li>Etrian Odyssey III used Limit Skills, group skills used by more than one character to boost the party or damage enemies.</li><li>Etrian Odyssey IV introduces Burst Skills, which taps into a shared Burst Gauge to unleash special skills based on the charges needed.</li><li>Etrian Odyssey V uses Union Skills, race-based skills which uses a character's union gauge. Unlike the other games, characters start each journey in the labyrinth with a full gauge.</li></ul><h3>F.O.E.</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/112/1372789-69.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1372789\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"272\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 272px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/112/1372789-69.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1372789\"><img alt=\"F.O.E.!\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 272px) 100vw, 272px\" data-width=\"272\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/112/1372789-69.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/112/1372789-69.jpg 272w\"><noscript><img alt=\"F.O.E.!\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/112/1372789-69.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/112/1372789-69.jpg 272w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 272px) 100vw, 272px\" data-width=\"272\"></noscript></a><figcaption>F.O.E.!</figcaption></figure><p>Formido Oppugnatura Exsequens, more commonly known by its acronym F.O.E., are <a href=\"/mini-boss/3015-420/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-420\">minibosses</a> that appear in the Labyrinth. They are much tougher than the normal enemies on their floor. F.O.E.s either patrol a set path or guard certain spots, and some will aggressively track the player while others are content to do their own thing. An F.O.E can invade a player's ongoing combat, turning a normal battle into a much more dangerous one, and players can only escape from an F.O.E. battle with they have a tile to retreat onto (except in Etrian Odyssey IV).</p><p><a href=\"/etrian-odyssey/3030-14350/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14350\">Etrian Odyssey</a> had two types of F.O.E.s: a normal orange type, and a much stronger red type, while <a href=\"/etrian-odyssey-ii-heroes-of-lagaard/3030-20511/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20511\">Etrian Odyssey II</a> adds a blue flying type that ignores terrain, and a purple stealth type that does not appear on the player's map.

Instead, the F.O.E. is fully rendered in 3D.</p><p>The Etrian Mystery Dungeon games have instead D.O.E.s, which have a similar function to F.O.E.s from the mainline games.

Materials can be dropped by enemies after a battle, or harvested through item resource points found scattered about the Labyrinth. Resource harvesting requires investment into Chop, Take, and Mine skills (except in Etrian Odyssey IV), and are limited to a certain number of tries in a day. Some special materials can only be gathered by killing monsters in a special way, like using a specific type of attack or killing them within certain turns. Almost all equipment and items are limited to the amount of materials gathered and sold by the player.</p><p>For games after Etrian Odyssey II, players can further enhance their weapons through <a href=\"/smithing/3015-3621/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3621\">forging</a>. Players collect special hammers through quests and treasure chests, and those hammers can be used to add new effects to player weapons. Each piece of equipment has a limited amount of forge slots, some more than others. There are also weapons that come with slots used, and these slots cannot be forged over. Players need to use money and materials (taken from the materials sold to the shop) to forge their weapons.</p><h3>Post Game</h3><p>All Etrian Odyssey games feature a post-game stratum, a maze with devilishly hard enemies and fiendish traps, more dangerous than the main game. At the end of the stratum players fight a hidden ultimate boss that is much tougher than the final boss of the main storyline. Players also gain access to many other <a href=\"/optional-boss/3015-1110/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1110\">optional bosses</a>, hidden within the different strata of the Labyrinth. <a href=\"/etrian-odyssey-iii-the-drowned-city/3030-29469/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-29469\">Etrian Odyssey III</a> also introduced many optional bosses as part of its Sea Quests, which are unlocked through the sailing minigame.</p><p>Etrian Odyssey III also introduced a <a href=\"/new-game-plus/3015-150/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-150\">New Game Plus</a> mode, where players can start over the storyline with their leveled characters, equipment, and drawn maps. This allows players to see all the different endings without having to grind through the entire game again. New Game Plus returns in Etrian Odyssey IV, with all the quests, key items, and class unlocks reset, and the only equipment carried over are those equipped on the player's characters.</p><h2>Development</h2><p>Etrian Odyssey was first announced in 2006 in Famitsu, after being shown behind closed doors in E3 2006. The first game was led by <a href=\"/kazuya-niinou/3040-91079/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-91079\">Kazuya Niinou</a>, but from the second game onwards, story writer <a href=\"/shigeo-komori/3040-90822/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-90822\">Shigeo Komori</a> took over as the lead of the franchise. The character art for the franchise is done by Japanese illustrator <a href=\"/yuji-himukai/3040-90863/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-90863\">Yuji Himukai</a>. For Etrian Odyssey IV, <a href=\"/daisuke-kanada/3040-90697/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-90697\">Daisuke Kanada</a> took over as the game's director as Komori was busy with other projects that the time. The Untold games are directed by Komori again.</p><p>The game was originally planned to be released as \"Yggdrasil Labyrinth\" worldwide, but was renamed to avoid confusion with <a href=\"/yggdra-union-well-never-fight-alone/3030-21640/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21640\">Yggdra Union</a> and <a href=\"/deep-labyrinth/3030-18580/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18580\">Deep Labyrinth</a>, both also published by <a href=\"/atlus-usa-inc/3010-6490/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6490\">Atlus USA</a> in the year before.</p><p>Each of the games has an image that inspires the style the game and its Yggdrasil Labyrinth. Etrian Odyssey was based on the green sea of trees, Etrian Odyssey II, the chill sky of North Europe, and Etrian Odyssey III, the warm southern seas.</p><h3>Etrian Odyssey Untold</h3><p>On 25 March, 2013, Komori teased on Twitter a \"new experiment\" for Etrian Odyssey, and a few days later, <a href=\"/etrian-odyssey-untold-the-millennium-girl/3030-42076/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-42076\">Etrian Odyssey Untold: The Millennium Girl</a> was announced on Famitsu. This game was a remake of the first Etrian Odyssey, but with a greater emphasis on story, including fully animated story cut-scenes. It introduced a premade party with set characters, a first for the series. Players could still play with a created party with Classic Mode, and there are 3 difficulty levels: Picnic, Normal, and Expert. The game was released in the US on Oct 1, 2013, and on May 12, 2014 in Europe.</p><p>On Aug 5, 2014, the remake of the Etrian Odyssey II, <a href=\"/etrian-odyssey-2-untold-the-fafnir-knight/3030-47341/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-47341\">Etrian Odyssey 2 Untold: The Fafnir Knight</a>, was announced. It follows the precedent set by Millennium Girl, with a premade party and more emphasis on story. It also features an upgraded grimoire system, and a restaurant <a href=\"/minigames/3015-116/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-116\">minigame</a> where players gathered ingredients and made food based on recipes found throughout the game. Fafnir Knight was also the first Etrian Odyssey game to feature <a href=\"/downloadable-content/3015-329/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-329\">DLC</a>, with new quests and bosses available to puchase. It was released Nov 27, 2014 in Japan, Aug 4, 2015 in the US, and Feb 12, 2016 in Europe.</p><h3>Soundtrack</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/931/1334712-yuzo_koshiro__1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1334712\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/931/1334712-yuzo_koshiro__1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1334712\"><img alt=\"Yuzo Koshiro\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/931/1334712-yuzo_koshiro__1_.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/931/1334712-yuzo_koshiro__1_.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/931/1334712-yuzo_koshiro__1_.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Yuzo Koshiro\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/931/1334712-yuzo_koshiro__1_.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/931/1334712-yuzo_koshiro__1_.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/931/1334712-yuzo_koshiro__1_.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Yuzo Koshiro</figcaption></figure><p>Etrian Odyssey was scored and arranged by renowned video game composer <a href=\"/yuzo-koshiro/3040-5461/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-5461\">Yuzo Koshiro</a>, known for his works in <a href=\"/streets-of-rage/3025-322/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-322\">Streets of Rage</a> and <a href=\"/actraiser/3025-631/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-631\">ActRaiser</a>. Koshiro was specifically picked by Niinou due to his ability to create nostalgic-sounding music.The first 3 games featured an frequency modulation (FM) synthesized soundtrack, composed via music software Cubase, with sound samples pulled from the <a href=\"/nec-pc-8801/3045-109/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-109\">PC-88</a>. The soundtrack was mixed with FM sound sources from Cubase, as the PC-88 tunes would sound flat played back on the DS soundchip. The official soundtracks features both versions of all tunes. Etrian Odyssey IV discards the synthesized soundtrack for a fully orchestrated one, as Kanada wanted something new with the change in platform (DS to 3DS). The Untold remakes keep both the original FM music, and provides a new orchestral arrange for both old tracks and new tracks, with the ability to switch on the fly.</p><p>The popularity of Etrian Odyssey's soundtrack led to the creation of several arranged albums, both official and fan-made.

The franchise (particularly the original game) have been widely praised for their innovative story-telling, a trait many consider rare in video games.</p><p>The BioShock franchise takes place in the 1950s and '60s in the underwater world of <a href=\"/rapture/3035-66/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-66\">Rapture</a> - a <a href=\"/utopian-civilization/3015-1716/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1716\">utopian city</a> that has no <a href=\"/government/3015-4262/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4262\">government</a>, no <a href=\"/religion/3015-1594/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1594\">religion</a>, just man. The city was created by a man named <a href=\"/andrew-ryan/3005-424/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-424\">Andrew Ryan</a> who was sick of the pressure and anxiety from the political, religious, and social world on the surface. He decided to create his own world underwater, free of any Gods or government, a place where people could achieve things for themselves rather than for the benefit of anyone else.</p><p>In Bioshock Infinite, Rapture is traded out for the hovering city of Columbia. The game takes place several decades before the original game, at the turn of the 20th century.</p><h2>BioShock</h2><ul><li>Released: August 21, 2007</li><li>Platforms: <a href=\"/xbox-360/3045-20/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-20\">Xbox 360</a>, <a href=\"/playstation-3/3045-35/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-35\">PS3</a>, <a href=\"/pc/3045-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a></li><li>Main article: <a href=\"/bioshock/3030-17280/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17280\">BioShock</a></li></ul><h3>Story</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17441/610073-ryan.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-610073\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.2461538461538\" data-width=\"130\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 130px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:124.6%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17441/610073-ryan.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-610073\"><img alt=\"Andrew Ryan\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17441/610073-ryan.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17441/610073-ryan.jpg 130w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 130px) 100vw, 130px\" data-width=\"130\"></a><figcaption>Andrew Ryan</figcaption></figure><p>In BioShock, players control a man named <a href=\"/jack-ryan/3005-4149/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4149\">Jack</a> who is unfortunate enough to be in a plane crash that lands in him in the <a href=\"/atlantic-ocean/3035-2650/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2650\">Atlantic Ocean</a>.

Throughout BioShock, you battle multiple enemies. There are a variety of weapons in the game including a revolver, a machine gun, a shotgun, and more. Every weapon in the game can be upgraded. Not only do you have guns, but you have strange powers called <a href=\"/plasmid/3055-24/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-24\">plasmids</a> at your disposal. Plasmids are injections that rewrite your DNA allowing you to shoot lighting, perform telekinesis, and more. These plasmids run on <a href=\"/eve/3015-4508/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4508\">EVE</a>, which is like mana. In order to buy more plasmids, you need <a href=\"/adam/3015-43/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-43\">ADAM</a>, a special material coming from a deep sea slug that has turned most of the Rapture residents into mindless maniacs. You also have <a href=\"/gene-tonics/3055-959/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-959\">tonics</a> which, at certain points in the game, allow you to improve certain stats or <a href=\"/buff/3015-2615/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2615\">buffs</a>, like doing more damage with your guns or taking less damage.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1840/236314-bioshock_water.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-236314\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.703125\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1840/236314-bioshock_water.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-236314\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/1840/236314-bioshock_water.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/1840/236314-bioshock_water.jpg 1024w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/0/1840/236314-bioshock_water.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/1840/236314-bioshock_water.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/1840/236314-bioshock_water.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/1840/236314-bioshock_water.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/1840/236314-bioshock_water.jpg 1024w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/0/1840/236314-bioshock_water.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/1840/236314-bioshock_water.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/1840/236314-bioshock_water.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>There are no <a href=\"/cutscene/3015-22/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-22\">cutscenes</a> in BioShock. The game relies on <a href=\"/audio-diaries/3055-892/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-892\">audio diaries</a> to give the player more information about both the world and events that have taken place. A lot of the characters are built up solely through their diaries and audio logs of them speaking. As you play, you can collect these diaries and listen to them whenever you want, but they are optional. Also, you will often be talked to by characters in Rapture through a modified radio, and it's through this that you will receive instructions as you play. The game achieves much its character and tells lots of the story through clever set dressing - the environments of the game have been designed to show the player events that have taken place, build up the character of certain citizens of Rapture and to create the general atmosphere of the game.</p><p>You fight enemies called <a href=\"/splicers/3015-647/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-647\">Splicers</a> which have over modified their bodies and have gone mentally insane. There are many different types of Splicers. Some will just hit you with pipes, others climb on ceilings, and others throw bombs and shoot at you. There are also large creatures called \" <a href=\"/big-daddy/3015-624/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-624\">Big Daddies</a>\". They are big submarine suit guys that will not attack you unless you attack them. They protect little girls called \"<a href=\"/little-sisters/3015-1111/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1111\">Little Sisters</a>\". Big Daddies go around Rapture protecting the Little Sisters, whose job is to collect a substance called ADAM from human bodies. At a certain point in the game, you gain the ability to either save the little girls for 80 ADAM or extract the ADAM from her, which kills her, but you get 160 ADAM. The scientist <a href=\"/bridgette-tenenbaum/3005-1072/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1072\">Tenenbaum</a> gives you a plasmid to save the little girls, and if you start saving every 3-4 Little Sisters, she will reward you with 200 ADAM, a special tonic or plasmid only available only by saving little sisters, and ammo. The rewards are presented at a nearby <a href=\"/gatherers-garden/3055-887/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-887\">Gatherers Garden</a> in a <a href=\"/teddy-bear/3055-945/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-945\">teddy bear</a>.</p><h2>BioShock 2</h2><ul><li>Released: February 9, 2010</li><li>Platforms: Xbox 360, PS3, PC</li><li>Main article: <a href=\"/bioshock-2/3030-20827/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20827\">BioShock 2</a></li><li>Giant Bomb Review: (Jeff Gerstmann)</li></ul><h3>Story</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/1263555-sofialamb.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1263555\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.1063394683027\" data-width=\"489\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 489px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:110.6%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/1263555-sofialamb.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1263555\"><img alt=\"The new leader of Rapture and its inhabitants.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 578px) 100vw, 578px\" data-width=\"578\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17172/1263555-sofialamb.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17172/1263555-sofialamb.jpg 489w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/17172/1263555-sofialamb.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The new leader of Rapture and its inhabitants.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17172/1263555-sofialamb.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17172/1263555-sofialamb.jpg 489w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/17172/1263555-sofialamb.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 578px) 100vw, 578px\" data-width=\"578\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The new leader of Rapture and its inhabitants.</figcaption></figure><p>BioShock 2 takes place in the year 1968. With Andrew Ryan out of the picture, Rapture was left without a ruler and experienced a societal collapse. A woman named Sofia Lamb, whose ideas and views conflicted with Ryan's, took control and not only brought religion to Rapture but also began spreading her collectivist philosophy throughout the society. At the beginning of the game, Sofia Lamb takes the Little Sister your character (a Big Daddy named Subject Delta) was bound to and leaves you for dead. You wake up 10 years later and must go on a hunt to find your \"daughter\", since the bonding left you with a side effect that causes your body to shut down if you're apart for too long.</p><h3>Main Characters</h3><ul><li><a href=\"/sofia-lamb/3005-12998/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-12998\"><b>Sofia Lamb</b></a>: In BioShock 2, Lamb controls Rapture.

One of the more notable ones is the ability to fire weapons and plasmids at the same time rather than having to switch between the two. You can also upgrade certain plasmids to fire in a stream, dealing out continuous damage to your foes.</p><p>An important aspect of BioShock 2 is the ability to adopt Little Sisters. Because you are a Big Daddy, the Little Sisters trust you and will gather ADAM for you at your command. While they are gathering ADAM from a corpse, they will attract the attention of the Splicers. Before this happens you can set up traps and prepare for the onslaught. Once they gather ADAM, you can then decide to either rescue them or harvest them. If the player deals with every Little Sister in a level, a Big Sister in summoned. They are the most powerful foes in the game due to their incredible agility and unmatched strength. Players need to utilize all of their abilities to bring one down; simply shooting the Big Sister will almost never be enough.</p><p>BioShock 2 is similar in gameplay to the first game, although players cannot enter an area once they leave it. Players use a train to go from one place to the next, and the train is incapable of moving backwards. Thus, those that wish to deal with every Little Sister must do so before leaving the level, as there is no going back.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1182222-emperorhands.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1182222\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1182222-emperorhands.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1182222\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/30/1182222-emperorhands.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/30/1182222-emperorhands.jpg 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/0/30/1182222-emperorhands.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1182222-emperorhands.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/30/1182222-emperorhands.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/30/1182222-emperorhands.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/30/1182222-emperorhands.jpg 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/0/30/1182222-emperorhands.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1182222-emperorhands.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/30/1182222-emperorhands.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>A surprising addition in BioShock 2 is online multiplayer. Several traditional modes are in place, including a unique twist on Capture The Flag where the flag is a Little Sister. Dubbed the \"prequel\" to BioShock, players will run around levels from the first game in the series as they were before the fall of Rapture. The appearance of the Splicer you play as can be customized, but only the melee weapon and the mask/hat they wear. Players also have three loadouts that can be customized. The loadouts include two primary weapons with or without unique perk-like abilities, two plasmids, and three tonics. During a game, players can hack vending machines so that they kill an enemy should they get to close. Turrets in each level can also be hacked so they shoot enemies. However, both of these can be re-sabotaged, although an already-hacked vending machine needs to be frozen before an enemy hacks it for their team, lest they get killed by the grenade that falls out.</p><p>In most game modes, a Big Daddy suit will occasionally spawn somewhere on the map. The person that finds it can don the suit, gaining increased strength, a powerful weapon, and the ability to throw proximity mines. In addition to these features is the ability to research dead enemies. By taking a picture of a dead enemy (done by holding a button, not by equipping a camera) the player will gain a damage bonus against that person. The damage bonus remains until the person kills the enemy that has the bonus against them. (When you become a Big Daddy, all damage bonuses are removed).</p><h2>BioShock Infinite</h2><ul><li>Released: March 26, 2013</li><li>Platforms: Xbox 360, PC, PS3</li><li>Main article: <a href=\"/bioshock-infinite/3030-32317/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-32317\">BioShock Infinite</a></li></ul><h3>Story</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/176/1475725-columbia_image_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1475725\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.52356020942408\" data-width=\"955\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 955px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:52.4%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/176/1475725-columbia_image_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1475725\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/176/1475725-columbia_image_1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/176/1475725-columbia_image_1.jpg 955w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/176/1475725-columbia_image_1.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/176/1475725-columbia_image_1.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/176/1475725-columbia_image_1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/176/1475725-columbia_image_1.jpg 955w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/176/1475725-columbia_image_1.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/176/1475725-columbia_image_1.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>The third installment in the BioShock series represents a major change for the series.

He visits the city to locate and rescue a woman named <a href=\"/elizabeth/3005-16204/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-16204\">Elizabeth</a>, and the two will go through many perilous adventures in Columbia together.</p><p>The city of Columbia itself was created by the <a href=\"/the-united-states-of-america/3035-396/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-396\">US</a> as a sort of symbol representing their superiority in the world and perhaps their arrogance as well. It was meant to be flown to countries all around the world to show off. During the Boxer Rebellion in China, Columbia attempted to provide aid but was called off by the United States. The floating city saw this as an act of betrayal, and promptly succeeded from the United States.</p><h3>Main Characters</h3><ul><li><b><a href=\"/booker-dewitt/3005-16203/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-16203\">Booker Dewitt</a> -</b> The main character of BioShock Infinite</li><li><b><a href=\"/elizabeth/3005-16204/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-16204\">Elizabeth</a> -</b> Booker's companion throughout the game</li><li><a href=\"/zachary-hale-comstock/3005-22154/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-22154\"><strong>Comstock</strong></a> - The leader of Columbia who holds a grunge against the people who betrayed the city and practically anyone who isn't white</li></ul><h3>Gameplay</h3><p>BioShock Infinite features Plasmid-like abilities called Vigors. Rather than stabbing a needle into the arm, Vigors are consumed simply by drinking it. Players have more ways to use their Vigors than they could with Plasmids in previous BioShock games. Vigors can combined for varying effects. In addition are some unique and never-before seen abilities such as one called \"Murder Of Crows\" which summons a swarm of vicious crows. During combat, Booker is aided by Elizabeth who possesses the unique ability to summon \"tears,\" which are portals to other dimensions or times. Through these portals Elizabeth can pull in everything from crates of health to weapons to additional pieces of cover and more. She will also throw Booker ammo, health, and money that she finds.</p><p>The inhabitants of BioShock Infinite are crazy, but maybe less-so than in Rapture.

Prior to Team Fortress, class-based gameplay was not common in FPS games. In standard multiplayer deathmatch modes players had the same skins and the same weapons to choose from. However, TF allowed players to choose vastly different classes for the first time.</p><p>Version 1 of TF was released for Quake with 5 classes: Scout, Sniper, Soldier, Demolitions Man and Medic. After 8 months all 9 classes had been added, according to the <a href=\"https://www.quaddicted.com/webarchive/www.planetfortress.com/teamfortress/versions.html\" rel=\"nofollow \">changelog</a>. On December 22nd 1996 the mod was released for QuakeWorld, the official multiplayer-optimised version of Quake. This caused an explosion in popularity for the mod, with the <a href=\"http://www.bluesnews.com/cgi-bin/board.pl?action=viewthread&amp;boardid=1&amp;threadid=48385&amp;id=162488\" rel=\"nofollow \">TFC press release</a> claiming that 40% of all QuakeWorld servers were dedicated to TF. This popularity lasted for approximately a year, with servers and players decreasing gradually after that. As of 2015, there are 17 QuakeWorld TF servers running.</p><p>By 2000 several modded versions of Team Fortress had been developed. MegaTF added sounds, crouching and the ability for each class to drop traps, among other things. CustomTF gave players the ability to purchase variously priced weapons, armour, leg speed, grenades and skills from a budget. This gives players the ability to have both a sniper rifle and a rocket launcher if desired, but not much money would be left over for armour or speed. Such mods has kept small pockets of players engaged for many years after the initial release of TF.</p><h3>Team Fortress Classic (TFC)</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15908/1202814-team_fortress_classic_2fort.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1202814\" data-ratio=\"0.614\" data-width=\"500\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:61.4%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15908/1202814-team_fortress_classic_2fort.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1202814\"><img alt=\"2fort from TFC\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/15908/1202814-team_fortress_classic_2fort.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/15908/1202814-team_fortress_classic_2fort.jpg 500w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/15908/1202814-team_fortress_classic_2fort.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/15908/1202814-team_fortress_classic_2fort.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>2fort from TFC</figcaption></figure><p>The team behind Quake TF were working on a sequel, to be released for the <a href=\"/quake-ii/3030-3207/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3207\">Quake 2</a> engine. <a href=\"/valve-corporation/3010-1374/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1374\">Valve</a> hired the team and announced <a href=\"/team-fortress-classic/3030-4561/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4561\">Team Fortress Classic</a>: a version of the original Team Fortress mod that ran on Valve's own <a href=\"/goldsrc/3015-1245/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1245\">GoldSrc</a> engine.

For example: the Soldier class has a rocket launcher and average movement speed, but the Scout class can move much faster and has less armour and fire-power. Players can go on the offence with classes like Soldier or Heavy Weapons Guy, or defence with the Sniper or Demolitions Man. Support classes are also available, like Medic or Engineer. Some players choose to play defensive classes offensively, or vice versa, which catches other players off guard and adds another layer of complexity to the gameplay.</p><p>After choosing a class, players choose a team. Two opposing sides, usually coloured red and blue, battle over multiple objectives on maps designed for the game. The most popular game mode has historically been capture the flag, but certain maps introduced original concepts like \"protect the president\" or \"cross the border\". Points are awarded for completing objectives. Once a time limit is reached, the team with the most points wins.</p><h3>Quake TF Gameplay</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/27/274285/2809125-1677680181-tumbl.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2809125\" data-ratio=\"0.615\" data-width=\"200\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:61.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/27/274285/2809125-1677680181-tumbl.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2809125\"><img alt=\"Nail Grenade, used by the Soldier\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/27/274285/2809125-1677680181-tumbl.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/27/274285/2809125-1677680181-tumbl.jpg 200w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Nail Grenade, used by the Soldier\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/27/274285/2809125-1677680181-tumbl.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/27/274285/2809125-1677680181-tumbl.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Nail Grenade, used by the Soldier</figcaption></figure><p>One major feature from the early TF mods is grenades. In addition to a small selection of weapons, each class has one normal grenade and one special grenade, which varies depending on the class chosen. The Heavy Weapons Guy can throw an MIRV grenade, which explodes and disperses into 6 more grenades. The Scout has a concussion grenade which causes major knock-back plus a screen movement effect to anybody hit by the blast. The knock-back of the concussion grenade can also be used by the scout to boost his speed even further, and to reach high places. This sort of exploit, along with bunny hopping, is a hallmark of Quake TF gameplay.</p><p>Some other features of Quake TF gameplay include:</p><ul><li>The spy can feign death, hoping other players would ignore him</li><li>Scouts can drop caltrops which hurt &amp; slow players who walk on them</li><li>The Demoman can set a detpack, which is a timed insta-kill explosion with a huge blast radius.</li></ul><h3>TF2 Gameplay</h3><p>Players of the original mods found that the removal of grenades was the most noticeable change, apart from the new art style. Removing grenades gave each class more clearly defined logistical roles on the battlefield. For example, having removed the offensive capability of grenades, the scout was limited more to be simply the capturing class and the medic's focus was narrowed to healing team-mates rather than hurting enemies. Since then, the game has been updated with many more weapons and abilities, and players can customise classes in various ways.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2236/197479-goldrush_thumb_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-197479\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2236/197479-goldrush_thumb_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-197479\"><img alt=\"payload in TF2\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/2236/197479-goldrush_thumb_1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/2236/197479-goldrush_thumb_1.jpg 300w\"><noscript><img alt=\"payload in TF2\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/2236/197479-goldrush_thumb_1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/2236/197479-goldrush_thumb_1.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"></noscript></a><figcaption>payload in TF2</figcaption></figure><p>The blue and red teams were given official names: BLU (Builders League United) and RED (Reliable Excavation Demolition), fictional construction companies battling it out according to an overblown and complex story. New game modes were created for TF2. Control Point sees teams competing to capturing control points, while Payload involves the BLU team slowly moving a bomb cart to a location in the RED team's base.</p><h4>Effect of \"Class Updates\" and Free-to-Play</h4><p>The three items of <a href=\"/melee/3015-444/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-444\">melee</a>, <a href=\"/secondary-weapons/3015-3303/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3303\">secondary</a>, and primary <a href=\"/weapon/3015-562/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-562\">weapon</a>s (with <a href=\"/spy/3005-488/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-488\">notable</a> <a href=\"/engineer/3005-485/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-485\">exceptions</a>) were maintained across both games but Team Fortress 2 in the modern age of <a href=\"/downloadable-content/3015-329/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-329\">DLC</a> vividly defined what the series will surely be known for many years to come: unlockable, items, and the in-game economy. Each class has at this point in time received a \"class update\" which gives them three items to replace existing ones with emphasis on <a href=\"/buff/3015-2615/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2615\">buffs</a> and <a href=\"/debuff/3015-2616/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2616\">debuff</a>s of the class acting less as overall upgrades more enhancements to play styles. In addition Valve has expanded the means with which players may obtain items including random drops determined by play length and a fully stocked store of in game weapons and accessories. The gameplay of \"Team Fortress\" can now more accurately be defined by customizable and specialized classes that are all balanced to play with and against each other to achieve a collective goal on a battlefield. Oh right, and <a href=\"/hat/3055-749/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-749\">hats</a>. The new development of <a href=\"/achievements/3015-29/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-29\">achievements</a>, <a href=\"/crafting/3015-934/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-934\">crafting</a>, and item drops creates a dualistic gameplay in which a player pursues goals to benefit his/her teammates as well as their own. This means Team Fortress joins many other modern multiplayer games as a game of player incentives that can be added and modified to balance the classes and play styles being used.</p><p>The next initiative that followed the introduction of a trading, crafting, and item acquisition system was naturally an in-game store. The introduction of the Mann Co. store was announced alongside the fact that the game will be Free to Play, fully adopting many aspects of emerging new game economic models.</p><h2>Classes</h2><p>There are 9 main classes in team fortress. Civilian class can also be chosen in certain maps in certain versions of TF. The details of each class shown here will differ between versions of TF, and players can also choose to play a class differently than expected, so treat this as a broad overview:</p><h3><a href=\"/scout/3005-365/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-365\"><b>Scout</b></a></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/27/274285/2811932-6183327462-Scout.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2811932\" data-ratio=\"1.5170068027211\" data-width=\"294\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 294px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/27/274285/2811932-6183327462-Scout.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2811932\"><img alt=\"from Quake Team Fortress\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 294px) 100vw, 294px\" data-width=\"294\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/27/274285/2811932-6183327462-Scout.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/27/274285/2811932-6183327462-Scout.png 294w\"><noscript><img alt=\"from Quake Team Fortress\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/27/274285/2811932-6183327462-Scout.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/27/274285/2811932-6183327462-Scout.png 294w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 294px) 100vw, 294px\" data-width=\"294\"></noscript></a><figcaption>from Quake Team Fortress</figcaption></figure><p>The scout moves faster than any other class, but is only supplied with light armour and weak weapons.

One of the major advantages over the Diablo games was the ability to purchase animals (mules) to allow for a much larger inventory while adventuring. The magic system was also much more diverse than that of Diablo. Kept in were many of the same addictive traits such as the replayabilty and the random loot drops. The characters develop skills based on what type of actions they take (shoot a bow often to increase your archery skill, use a certain magic to level it up faster). Also included was a co-op multiplayer that allowed for multiple people to band together to tackle the dungeons.</p><p> </p><p>The original game (<a href=\"/dungeon-siege/3030-2059/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2059\">Dungeon Siege</a>) was published on the PC and Mac, the stand alone <a href=\"/dungeon-siege-legends-of-aranna/3030-13293/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13293\">expansion pack</a> was only made available for the PC and contained the entire original game in the package.

Its core design was inspired by the game <i>Adventure</i>, but it quickly grew to become far larger and more complex, both in technology and content. The game was successful enough with the other MIT students that the core programmers founded <a href=\"/infocom/3010-1284/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1284\">Infocom</a> and ported it to a virtual machine technology they had developed called Z-Machine. Eventually Infocom was bought by <a href=\"/activision/3010-78/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-78\">Activision</a>, which released a few 3-D graphical adventures using the locations and backstory that had been developed. The most recent of these to be made was <a href=\"/zork-grand-inquisitor/3030-1600/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1600\">Zork: Grand Inquisitor</a>. In 2009 Activision licensed the name out to <a href=\"/jolt-country/3010-500/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-500\">Jolt Country</a> who made a poorly received free-to-play game named <a href=\"/legends-of-zork/3030-25076/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-25076\">Legends of Zork</a>. It had some references to the series in terms of location names but none of the same gameplay and not much story connection. It was really part of the franchise in name only.</p><h2>Characters</h2><p>In the original text adventure series you played as a nameless adventurer, wandering around a deserted land once known as Frobozz once populated by people called Frobozzicans who were ruled by flat-headed leaders (literally named Flatheads); all of whom have since vanished. The only other characters you meet is a thief, who can steal from you and may kill you but does not say anything and a troll. The later 3-D adventure games (especially <i>Grand Inquisitor</i>) take place in other time periods and have more characters.</p><h2>Locations</h2><p>At the start of Zork I you are above ground, near a small white house. You can wander around in the forest a bit, and later on you float down a river and arrive at a beach, but the majority of the game takes place inside the <a href=\"/great-underground-empire/3035-665/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-665\">Great Underground Empire</a>. As the name implies, the G.U.E. was located underground in a large system of caves, accessed via a trap door inside the house. Other games in the series similarly take place in a mixture of above- and below-ground environments.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Gameplay follows the typical adventure game formula and consists of visiting the various areas and collecting the objects you find along the way. Sometimes there are puzzles to solve with the objects you have collected or portions of the environment. If you meet the thief or the troll you can engage in brief swordfights with them, which are turn-based and decided by dice rolls.</p>", "guid": "3025-660", "name": "Zork"}, {"description": "<p>Released hot on the heels of Konami's groundbreaking <a data-ref-id=\"3025-56\" href=\"/beatmania/3025-56/\" slug=\"beatmania\">beatmania</a>, pop'n music was originally envisioned as taking the rhythm game concept and applying it to something couples could enjoy together. A design standard was immediately set that included cute characters (both human and anthropomorphic), bright colors, and a wide variety of musical genres. Over the years the game has branched out a great deal and fleshed out not only the multiplayer component (battle and net-taisen modes), but also offering an extremely robust and difficult single player experience. While friendly looking on the outside, pop'n music offers some of the most challenging songs in all of Konami's music game offerings.</p><p>Over the years the franchise has also become something of a merchandising behemoth with soundtracks, plush characters, clothing, trading cards, and even tea sets being produced. Many of these items are only available by playing Japanese UFO catcher machines, but a wide variety of this merchandise is also available through konamistyle. Nearly every character in the series' 20+ games has received the merchandise treatment in one way or another, with the most popular characters being offered in nearly every format you can think of.</p>", "guid": "3025-661", "name": "pop'n music"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-662", "name": "Zone of the Enders"}, {"description": "<p>The World of Mana (a.k.a.

While the main character in the original game experiences his story on one side of the island, Warhead takes place in the different side of the island.</p><p>One of the first things that the Crytek team stated about Warhead is the optimization. Crytek stated that the original game was not opened enough for the general PC audience resulting in parts of the audience not playing the game. They have also stated that the graphics have improved slightly, but have not drastically changed. Also they have stated that loading times will be slightly shorter then the ones in the first game.</p><h2>Improvements to CryEngine 2</h2><p>Crysis has specifically stated that the core CryEngine 2 is undergoing many changes most of which will enable Crysis Warhead to perform better on all systems and to have lower minimum system requirements as well as being optimized to all PC hardware. One of the notable changes is that Warhead will have more number of enemies on screen for a lesser frame-rate hit than the original.</p><p>The developers have also added three predetermined graphics levels -- Mainstream, Gamer, and Enthusiast -- which will help gamers to run the game on a variety of systems right off the bat without optimizing or changing specific settings. Though the developers have also specifically stated that Enthusiast may not provide the highest level of visual detail possible in the game.</p><p>Enemy AI has also been greatly improved to suit the playing style of Psycho as well as to provide a better experience overall in general. The developers have stated in many interviews that, whereas in Crysis sometimes enemies might pause for a moment once the player appears in view, the AI in Warhead will be more tighter with enemies flanking and taking out the player quickly and effectively.</p>", "guid": "3025-665", "name": "Crysis"}, {"description": "<p>The Simon the Sorcerer franchise is a series of <a data-ref-id=\"3015-75\" href=\"/point-and-click/3015-75/\" slug=\"point-and-click\">          point-and-click</a> adventure games created by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-254\" href=\"/adventure-soft-publishing-ltd/3010-254/\" slug=\"adventure-soft-publishing-ltd\">           Adventure Soft</a>.

You generally begin with a single Hero unit and fight your way to gain new units, power them up or buy some new talent.\u00a0 <br/>\u00a0<br/>Your single hero is the element you have control over and you can use him/her to capture resources, engage in combat and give bonuses to your growing army. Heroes also have special powers they can use to turn the tide of a battle.\u00a0 <br/>\u00a0<br/>Your hero gains experience from each battle they win, making them stronger the more they fight. Veteran heroes are much stronger than newbie ones. Heroes persist through a single campaign, but don't carry over to your new scenario. <br/>\u00a0<br/><h2>Gameplay<br/></h2>You start a game with a single hero unit and a town that you're in alliance with. Each town you can choose from features custom native heroes, bonuses or abilities. They also have a slight tendancy towards a specific type of magic. <br/>\u00a0<br/>The town you own are paramount to your success. With them you can gain gold, spend the gold to increase your military prowess and become a better army all around. A typical goal in many scenarios is to capture all enemy towns.<br/>\u00a0<br/>There is also a side objective that consists of finding a rare item hidden beneath a random tile in the map.\u00a0 <br/>\u00a0<br/><h3>Heroes I - Heroes II<br/></h3>Ultimate Artifact <br/>\u00a0<br/><h3>Heroes III - Heroes IV<br/></h3>Grail <br/>\u00a0<br/><h3>Heroes V<br/></h3>Tear of Asha\u00a0 <br/>\u00a0<br/>As your hero is moved from obelisk to obelisk, pieces are moved from the treasure map, gradually giving you the location of the item.

Common threads include the ability to play scenarios from multiple sides and fighting off hundreds if not thousands of enemies in a single battle. The Musou franchise name most commonly relates to its core series, Dynasty Warriors, but also encompasses Samurai Warriors and a number of other series.</p><h2>Franchise Branches</h2><h3>Dynasty Warriors</h3><p>The original Musou franchise, <a href=\"/dynasty-warriors/3025-169/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-169\">Dynasty Warriors</a> depicts a loose adaptation of <a href=\"/romance-of-the-three-kingdoms/3025-388/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-388\"><em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</em></a>. The first <a href=\"/dynasty-warriors/3030-9658/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9658\">Dynasty Warriors</a> game, released on the <a href=\"/playstation/3045-22/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-22\">PlayStation</a>, was not a brawler, but a one-on-one fighting game. It wasn't until <a href=\"/dynasty-warriors-2/3030-15413/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15413\">Dynasty Warriors 2</a> that the game's roots as a brawler would take hold.</p><h3>Samurai Warriors</h3><p>The first spin-off Musou franchise, <a href=\"/samurai-warriors/3025-947/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-947\">Samurai Warriors</a> takes the same basic gameplay concepts as the Dynasty Warriors series, but set during the <a href=\"/warring-states-era/3015-4006/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4006\">Warring States era</a> of Japanese history. As the second \"core\" Musou franchise, it has evolved along a different path from the Dynasty Warriors series and was the first to introduce elements such as an experience point-based leveling system, branching paths in missions, and more character-specific abilities.</p><h3>Warriors Orochi</h3><p><a href=\"/warriors-orochi/3025-1199/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1199\">Warriors Orochi</a> is a crossover series that takes the characters of Dynasty Warriors and Samurai Warriors and pits them in battle against the demonic forces of the evil <a href=\"/orochi/3005-10495/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-10495\">Orochi</a> and his minions. As the series has progressed, it has included more and more characters from outside the two primary franchises, including characters from other Musou titles as well as non-Musou related Koei Tecmo properties.</p><h3>Dynasty Warriors: Gundam</h3><p>The first Musou franchise to be based on a licensed property. The Dynasty Warriors: Gundam series is based on the popular <a href=\"/gundam/3025-290/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-290\">Gundam</a> anime franchise. The games commonly depict both stories adapted from series and movies represented as well as original crossover stories that feature characters from across the various Gundam universes and timelines. Various aspects of gameplay in these games are adapted to fit the fact that the player is actually piloting a mobile suit.</p><h3>Warriors: Legends of Troy</h3><p>The one-off Musou title <a href=\"/warriors-legends-of-troy/3030-26881/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-26881\">Warriors: Legends of Troy</a> bears the distinction of being the only Musou title developed by <a href=\"/koei-canada-inc/3010-6326/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6326\">Koei Canada</a>. Set during the Trojan War, the game adapts elements of the Musou format for a more western-themed setting and style.</p><h3>Fist of the North Star: Ken's Rage</h3><p>Like Dynasty Warriors: Gundam, <a href=\"/fist-of-the-north-star-kens-rage/3030-29036/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-29036\">Fist of the North Star: Ken's Rage</a> is based on the popular 1980s post-apocalyptic martial arts manga and anime <em><a href=\"/fist-of-the-north-star/3025-1023/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1023\">Fist of the North Star</a></em>. The first game tells an original version of the storyline up through the defeat of the villain <a href=\"/raoh/3005-13486/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-13486\">Raoh</a>. The <a href=\"/fist-of-the-north-star-kens-rage-2/3030-38563/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-38563\">second game</a> is a more complete and faithful adaptation of the manga and includes all but one story arc.</p><h3>One Piece: Pirate Warriors</h3><p>One Piece: Pirate Warriors is another series of Musou titles based on an anime/manga property; in this case, the pirate-themed <em><a href=\"/one-piece/3025-468/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-468\">One Piece</a></em>. Similar to Dynasty Warriors: Gundam and Fist of the North Star: Ken's Rage, entries in this series feature separate story modes that depict canonical events of the series as well as an alternate take.</p><h3>Hyrule Warriors</h3><p><a href=\"/hyrule-warriors/3030-44782/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-44782\">Hyrule Warriors</a> takes <a href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-90\">Nintendo's</a> <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda/3025-9/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-9\">Legend of Zelda</a> franchise and adapts it to the Musou format. The game features characters from throughout the Zelda timeline in an original story and mixes Zelda elements into the beat'em up gameplay.

Entries in the series have typically defied a number of the conventions of the JRPG subgenre. It was created by <a data-ref-id=\"3040-48599\" href=\"/akitoshi-kawazu/3040-48599/\" slug=\"akitoshi-kawazu\">Akitoshi Kawazu</a>, who joined Squaresoft in 1985 and worked as a game designer on <a data-ref-id=\"3030-8403\" href=\"/final-fantasy/3030-8403/\" slug=\"final-fantasy\">Final Fantasy</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-2094\" href=\"/final-fantasy-ii/3030-2094/\" slug=\"final-fantasy-ii\">Final Fantasy II</a>. The series began with the original SaGa, released on the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-3\" href=\"/game-boy/3045-3/\" slug=\"game-boy\">Game Boy</a>. In the west, Squaresoft marketed the game under the name <a data-ref-id=\"3030-18601\" href=\"/the-final-fantasy-legend/3030-18601/\" slug=\"the-final-fantasy-legend\">The Final Fantasy Legend</a> as a means to draw more interest, though the gameplay is remarkably different from that of the average Final Fantasy title. The Game Boy sequels, SaGa II and SaGa III, were likewise released under the names <a data-ref-id=\"3030-5827\" href=\"/final-fantasy-legend-ii/3030-5827/\" slug=\"final-fantasy-legend-ii\">Final Fantasy Legend II</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-19592\" href=\"/final-fantasy-legend-iii/3030-19592/\" slug=\"final-fantasy-legend-iii\">Final Fantasy Legend III</a>. The first SaGa title to see release in the west under its original name is the PlayStation entry <a data-ref-id=\"3030-14394\" href=\"/saga-frontier/3030-14394/\" slug=\"saga-frontier\">SaGa Frontier</a>.</p><p>The SaGa series began as a more traditionally linear RPG series, in which the player controls a single party through the course of the game and engages in events in a predetermined order. Later entries in the series, beginning with <a data-ref-id=\"3030-1368\" href=\"/romancing-saga/3030-1368/\" slug=\"romancing-saga\">Romancing SaGa</a> on the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-9\" href=\"/snes/3045-9/\" slug=\"snes\">Super Famicom</a>, opened up the gameplay for more non-linear progression. The games traditionally feature multiple protagonists, each with their own intersecting stories that can be played through in any order.</p><h2>Game Boy Origins</h2><p>The original SaGa features a gameplay system which allows the player to improve the statistics of the party members through actions taken in battle. For example, attacking with heavy weapons will randomly increase a character's strength statistic. This mechanic is similar in nature to the stat-building system found in Final Fantasy II. Additionally, monster party members can increase in power by consuming the meat of other defeated monsters.</p><p>SaGa allows players to form parties from multiple classes including male and female humans, male and female mutants, and a few species of monsters. SaGa also allowed its humanoid party members to equip weapons, items, armor and magic tomes, limited only by the open slots in a given member's inventory. As such, a single character can equip three swords if the player desires it. Weapons are also perishable, with a set number of uses. Natural monster abilities fall prey to this limitation as well; the only way to \"recharge\" said abilities is to stay and recover at an inn.</p><p>SaGa II adds the unique \"Robot\" class whose stats are completely dependent on what equipment it has equipped. The more powerful the item, the higher the robot's stats, with the exception of magical equipment. In SaGa III, the player's party members can eat monster meat, as in the first two games, and also install machine parts into their bodies. Character classes exist on a scale of Robot to Monster, with Human/Mutant existing as the neutral median. A character that has installed robot parts can revert to human or become a monster by subsequently eating monster meat.</p>", "guid": "3025-705", "name": "SaGa"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-706", "name": "Actua Sports"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-707", "name": "Seven Kingdoms"}, {"description": "<h3>List of Bemani franchises:</h3><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><a data-ref-id=\"3025-56\" href=\"/beatmania/3025-56/\" slug=\"beatmania\"> beatmania</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3025-853\" href=\"/beatmania-iidx/3025-853/\" slug=\"beatmania-iidx\"> beatmania IIDX</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3025-855\" href=\"/beatmania-iii/3025-855/\" slug=\"beatmania-iii\"> beatmania III</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3025-127\" href=\"/dance-dance-revolution/3025-127/\" slug=\"dance-dance-revolution\"> Dance Dance Revolution</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3025-661\" href=\"/popn-music/3025-661/\" slug=\"popn-music\"> pop'n music</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3025-288\" href=\"/guitarfreaks/3025-288/\" slug=\"guitarfreaks\"> GuitarFreaks</a></li><li>DrumMania</li><li>Mambo A Go Go</li><li>Dance Maniax</li><li>Keyboardmania</li><li>Karaoke Revolution</li><li>Dance Evolution</li><li>ParaParaParadise</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3030-22646\" href=\"/popn-stage/3030-22646/\" slug=\"popn-stage\"> pop'n stage</a></li><li>Dance 86.4</li><li>Toy's March</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3025-1901\" href=\"/jubeat/3025-1901/\" slug=\"jubeat\"> Jubeat</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3030-33086\" href=\"/reflec-beat/3030-33086/\" slug=\"reflec-beat\"> Reflec Beat</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3030-40933\" href=\"/sound-voltex/3030-40933/\" slug=\"sound-voltex\"> Sound Voltex Booth</a></li></ul><p>Despite being developed outside of Japan and having little to do with Konami's other music products, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20635\" href=\"/rock-revolution/3030-20635/\" slug=\"rock-revolution\"> Rock Revolution</a> is considered to be part of the Bemani line.

Starting in 2011 they also began utilizing the internet capabilities of their games in new ways, including additional DLC, unlock systems that span games (IE unlock songs on IIDX via playing jubeat), and even challenges requiring players to visit arcades in different prefectures. Now in the series' 15th anniversary Konami is updating each of it's key franchises to the HD standard, and adding even more user connectivity in the way of contests to include player made remixes as DLC for its games.</p>", "guid": "3025-708", "name": "Bemani"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-709", "name": "Parodius"}, {"description": "\u00a0\u00a0", "guid": "3025-710", "name": "Legaia"}, {"description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p><i>Shin Megami Tensei is a sub series of the</i> <a data-ref-id=\"3025-525\" href=\"/megami-tensei/3025-525/\" slug=\"megami-tensei\"><i>Megami Tensei</i></a> <i>franchise in Japan.
