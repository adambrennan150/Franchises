Characters have a damage counter that ranges between 0% and 999%. The higher the percentage, the farther the character is knocked away from an attack. To knockout an opponent (ie: make an opponent lose a life), they must be sent flying off-screen. The opponent has the ability to recover and grab hold of the closest platform if he/she is within reach. Matches are heavily customizable allowing you to set time limits, participate in coin battles, set the number of lives (up to 99), have special modifiers and more. Up to four players can participate in a match but you can opt to take on your opponent one on one if you so choose.</p><h3>Fighting System</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/27545/965231-super_smash_bros_brawl_20071207055708769.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-965231\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.7875\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:78.8%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/27545/965231-super_smash_bros_brawl_20071207055708769.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-965231\"><img alt=\"Mario, Snake, Yoshi and Zelda squaring off in Super Smash Bros.

Rather, all attacks are done with one or two buttons in combination with the analog stick. Each character has a normal attack that can be executed rapidly for a <a href=\"/combo/3015-18/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-18\">combo</a>. The button that executes the normal attack can be used with the analog stick to deliver directional attacks. Directional attacks can also be executed in mid-air. Characters can also do execute a harder <b>smash attack</b> which does much more damage than a normal attack but is slower to execute. <b>Smash attacks</b> can also be charged for even more damage. All characters have a shield and in combination with the analog stick, can sidestep attacks. In the air, the shield button does an <b>air dodge</b>. Lastly, all characters have multiple special attacks which are unique to each character. These attacks are done with pressing a button or using the button in combination with the analog stick. The skill in the game is not based around pulling off complicated combo's but rather about knowing the match-ups and having good timing.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5687/465899-samus_070718b_l.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-465899\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.8225\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:82.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5687/465899-samus_070718b_l.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-465899\"><img alt=\"Samus' Final Smash: the Zero Laser.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png 400w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Samus' Final Smash: the Zero Laser.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png 400w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Samus' Final Smash: the Zero Laser.</figcaption></figure><p>Super Smash Bros.

Due to their powerful nature, Final Smashes must be earned by breaking open a <a href=\"/smash-ball/3055-334/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-334\">Smash Ball</a> item - a sphere that moves around the stage after which players scramble for, these can also be turned off if you do not want to involve these attacks in the match.</p><p>The series also has a heavy reliance on items. Like the characters, most of these items are derived from popular Nintendo games, such as the <a href=\"/super-mushroom/3055-49/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-49\">Super Mushroom</a> from the Super Mario series, <a href=\"/poke-ball/3055-425/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-425\">Pok\u00e9balls</a> from the Pok\u00e9mon series, and the <a href=\"/smart-bomb/3055-227/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-227\">Smart Bomb</a> from the <a href=\"/star-fox/3025-329/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-329\">Starfox</a> series. Items can be classified into five categories: battering items (used to strike the opponent), throwing items (thrown at the opponent), shooting items (items that provide long-range damage), recovery items (used to recover damage), and support items (used to give the player an advantage in battle). Super Smash Bros. Brawl also introduces \"<a href=\"/assist-trophy/3055-245/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-245\">Assist Trophies</a>\" which, like Pok\u00e9balls, summons characters that benefit the player.

Developed by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-220\" href=\"/amusement-vision-ltd/3010-220/\" slug=\"amusement-vision-ltd\">        Amusement Vision</a> and published by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-62\" href=\"/sega/3010-62/\" slug=\"sega\">       Sega</a>, <i>Super Monkey Ball</i> is noted for its simple controls (usually only involving an analogue stick), innovative level design, infuriating challenges and unique graphical style. First appearing in arcades as <i>Monkey Ball,</i> the series made its console debut as a <a data-ref-id=\"3045-23\" href=\"/gamecube/3045-23/\" slug=\"gamecube\">      GameCube</a> launch title. <br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><br/>The objective of the single-player <i>Monkey Ball </i>is to guide your chosen primate through a goal placed at the end of the level. Between you and simian-success lies a series of fiendish obstacles to negotiate. As the game progresses they grow increasingly abstract and ever-more difficult. There are three difficulty levels: beginner, advanced and expert. Completing the whole game will unlock extra bonus levels which usually take the <i>Monkey Ball</i> concept to ridiculous extremes. Each level in <i>Monkey Ball</i> is littered with bananas (the favored food of the monkey population) which count for 100 points each. Finishing levels quickly also adds points, creating an element of strategy in that the player is forced to make decisions regarding whether the bonus gifted by a remote banana is greater than the time-bonus. Additionally, collecting 100 bananas will grant the player an extra life.<br/><br/>Other features have been added into the series as it has progressed. <a data-ref-id=\"3030-6961\" href=\"/super-monkey-ball-adventure/3030-6961/\" slug=\"super-monkey-ball-adventure\"> <i>Super Monkey Ball Adventure</i></a> relies on conventional platforming tropes for much of the gameplay. Additionally the game introduces a number of special balls such as StickyBall or WoodBall. These abilities are unlocked using chants which the monkey must recite in the correct order. Also, recent iterations have featured the ability to jump to avoid obstacles or get over gaps.<br/><br/><h2>Monkeys</h2><br/><i>Super Monkey Ball </i>features a number of playable primates, all with slightly different attributes which will affect their progress around the various levels.<br/><br/><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><a data-ref-id=\"3005-690\" href=\"/aiai/3005-690/\" slug=\"aiai\">    AiAi</a>: The Mario of the Monkey Ball series, AiAi is your classic all-rounder and serves as the lead character of the series.</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3005-2445\" href=\"/meemee/3005-2445/\" slug=\"meemee\">   MeeMee</a>: Wife of AiAi and apparently loved by all monkeys. </li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3005-2446\" href=\"/baby/3005-2446/\" slug=\"baby\"> Baby</a>: The child of AiAi and MeeMee.

When Dr. Zan Gilbert alerts Blaze to the existence of this plan, the team is reassembled to take down Mr. X yet again.</p><h2>Music</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/11342-koshiro.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-11342\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.86222222222222\" data-width=\"450\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 450px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:86.2%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/11342-koshiro.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-11342\"><img alt=\" Yuzo Koshiro \" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/30/11342-koshiro.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/30/11342-koshiro.jpg 450w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/30/11342-koshiro.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption> Yuzo Koshiro </figcaption></figure><p>The music of the Streets of Rage franchise is well known for its influence on techno (described by the composer, <a href=\"/yuzo-koshiro/3040-5461/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-5461\">Yuzo Koshiro</a>, as \"hardcore techno\"). The soundtracks have been released in a variety of forms, with the first soundtrack having been only released in Japan. The second soundtrack is arguably the easiest to attain, due to the fact that it was the only Streets of Rage soundtrack released in the United States (released in 2000). <a href=\"/streets-of-rage-3/3030-15924/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15924\">Streets of Rage 3</a>'s soundtrack was also released In Japan (in 1994, titled Bare Knuckle 3: Iron Fist Scriptures), although many of its tracks were also composed by <a href=\"/motohiro-kawashima/3040-39673/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-39673\">Motohiro Kawashima</a>.

These stories differ from what occurs in the game, and don't have Adam Hunter. The first story is titled <i>Streets of Rage</i>. This story centers around Axel, Blaze, and <a href=\"/max-thunder/3005-4479/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4479\">Max Thunder</a> as they search for an ex-cop turned crime boss, after they quit the corrupt police force in order to more easily fight crime.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1331129-stc_08_sor_03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1331129\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.3600944510035\" data-width=\"847\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 847px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:136.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1331129-stc_08_sor_03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1331129\"><img alt=\" Blaze and Max fight enemies in the first story.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px\" data-width=\"470\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/1331129-stc_08_sor_03.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/1331129-stc_08_sor_03.jpg 847w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/1331129-stc_08_sor_03.jpg 705w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/1331129-stc_08_sor_03.jpg 470w\"><noscript><img alt=\" Blaze and Max fight enemies in the first story.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/1331129-stc_08_sor_03.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/1331129-stc_08_sor_03.jpg 847w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/1331129-stc_08_sor_03.jpg 705w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/1331129-stc_08_sor_03.jpg 470w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px\" data-width=\"470\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Blaze and Max fight enemies in the first story.</figcaption></figure><p>The second story, titled <i>Skates' Story</i>, follows <a href=\"/skate/3005-4486/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4486\">Eddie \"Skate\" Hunter</a> and his origins as he joins Axel, Blaze, and Max's team in order to help fight crime after his parents are murdered by Mr. X.

All three of these games are very similar in mechanics and gameplay, although there are differences which set them apart. As traditional beat-em-ups, the goal of each level is to reach the end by beating up whatever enemies stand in the way. There are a variety of enemies to fight, along with a larger and more difficult boss character at the end or in the mid-level of each stage. When fighting an enemy, its life bar is displayed along with the player's, giving the player an idea of how much damage is being dealt. In the original <a href=\"/streets-of-rage/3030-20436/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20436\">Streets of Rage</a>, only bosses had their life bar displayed, which <a href=\"/streets-of-rage-2/3030-18122/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18122\">Streets of Rage 2</a> extended to regular enemies.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/139866/2694605-8820686945-26944.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2694605\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1440\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1440px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/139866/2694605-8820686945-26944.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2694605\"><img alt=\"Fighting one of the diverse boss enemies in the much improved sequel Streets of Rage 2\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/13/139866/2694605-8820686945-26944.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/13/139866/2694605-8820686945-26944.png 1440w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/13/139866/2694605-8820686945-26944.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/13/139866/2694605-8820686945-26944.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/13/139866/2694605-8820686945-26944.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Fighting one of the diverse boss enemies in the much improved sequel Streets of Rage 2\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/13/139866/2694605-8820686945-26944.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/13/139866/2694605-8820686945-26944.png 1440w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/13/139866/2694605-8820686945-26944.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/13/139866/2694605-8820686945-26944.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/13/139866/2694605-8820686945-26944.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Fighting one of the diverse boss enemies in the much improved sequel Streets of Rage 2</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to traditional moves and special moves (each character has several special moves--called Blitz moves--which can be utilized through specific button combinations), characters have a variety of weapons at their disposal. Players can use weapons such as <a href=\"/knife/3055-295/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-295\">knives</a>, <a href=\"/bottle/3055-133/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-133\">bottles</a>, <a href=\"/katana/3055-690/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-690\">katanas</a>, or <a href=\"/baseball-bat/3055-39/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-39\">baseball bats </a>(depending on the game).

Not only is the game more difficult (with more enemies onscreen and stronger attacks), but in the original Streets of Rage, playing with a second player opens up the possibility of getting the bad ending of the game, which can be activated when one player chooses to join Mr. X and the other chooses to fight Mr. X. This results in the two players being pitted against each other, making the bad ending a high possibility.</p><h2>Gameplay Differences</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/139866/2695001-1023-184844.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2695001\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1440\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1440px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/139866/2695001-1023-184844.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2695001\"><img alt=\"Streets of Rage 3 moves at a faster pace than the other games\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/13/139866/2695001-1023-184844.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/13/139866/2695001-1023-184844.png 1440w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/13/139866/2695001-1023-184844.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/13/139866/2695001-1023-184844.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/13/139866/2695001-1023-184844.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Streets of Rage 3 moves at a faster pace than the other games\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/13/139866/2695001-1023-184844.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/13/139866/2695001-1023-184844.png 1440w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/13/139866/2695001-1023-184844.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/13/139866/2695001-1023-184844.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/13/139866/2695001-1023-184844.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Streets of Rage 3 moves at a faster pace than the other games</figcaption></figure><p>The largest difference between the three Streets of Rage game is the pace of the gameplay. The slowest moving game by far is the first <a href=\"/streets-of-rage/3030-20436/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20436\">Streets of Rage</a>, which (in comparison to the sequels), is incredibly slow. This is countered by the much more powerful moves in Streets of Rage, whereas moves in <a href=\"/streets-of-rage-3/3030-15924/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15924\">Streets of Rage 3</a> result in much less enemy damage. <a href=\"/streets-of-rage-2/3030-18122/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18122\">Streets of Rage 2</a> is widely considered to be the ideal game of the franchise, with many critics and fans believing that it found the correct balance between speed and attack damage.</p><p>Special attacks are another large difference in the franchise. Streets of Rage offered a single special attack; the ability to call in a friendly police car that would decimate any enemies on the screen. This special attack could only be used once per life or once per level (and it could not be used on the final stage). Streets of Rage 2 and Streets of Rage 3 greatly expanded the characters' movesets, including a variety of Blitz moves that can be activated by doing a special button combination. These moves are much more powerful than regular moves, and take a chunk of health away from the player after performing them. In Streets of Rage 3, Blitz moves were expanded even more, allowing the player to level them up depending on the score.</p><h2>Playable Characters</h2><h3>Streets of Rage</h3><p>The first Streets of Rage had the smallest roster out of the trilogy. With only three playable characters and very limited differences between them, there is a noted lack of variety between the characters in this game. Also noteworthy is that this game was before each character had a unique special move. Pressing the special button with any character called in police backup at the beginning of the level who shoot missiles into the air which damage all enemies on screen.</p><h4>Adam</h4><p>Like all three characters Adam has two skills with an A rating and one with a B. His one weakness is speed, being the slowest of the three. Adam is the only character of the original three to never be playable in another game. He does, however, appear in the endings of Streets of Rage 2 and Streets of Rage 3.</p><h4>Axel</h4><p>Axel is the main character of the series, although the story has very little to do with him directly. Like all three characters Axel has two skills with an A rating and one with a B. His weakness is his ability to jump, having the weakest jump attacks in the game. Axel is the only character along with Blaze to be playable in all three games in the series.</p><h4>Blaze</h4><p>Blaze is the weakest of the three playable characters, with a B in power. She does, however, make up for this with her superior jump ability and natural walking speed. Blaze is the only character along with Axel to be playable in all three games in the series.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/138782/2727323-streetsofrage002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2727323\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"360\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 360px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/138782/2727323-streetsofrage002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2727323\"><img alt=\"The original three characters\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px\" data-width=\"360\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/13/138782/2727323-streetsofrage002.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/13/138782/2727323-streetsofrage002.jpg 360w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The original three characters\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/13/138782/2727323-streetsofrage002.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/13/138782/2727323-streetsofrage002.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px\" data-width=\"360\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The original three characters</figcaption></figure><p> </p><p> </p><h3>Streets of Rage 2</h3><p>Streets of Rage 2 was the first game in the series to feature more than three playable characters. It is also the game in the series with the most variety, introducing two completely new playable characters to the roster while including two originals. Streets of Rage 2 was the first game in the series to introduce character specific special and forward special attacks as well as dash attacks. The neutral special attacks cost a little bit of health when they connect with an enemy, but are free if they hit nothing. They are primarily used to clear the area around each character. The forward special attacks always cost health whether they connect or not. Compared to Streets of Rage 1 the variety in the characters is far greater. Adam is missing from the game as he was kidnapped by Mr. X. However joining Axel and Blaze on their journey to free their friend are Max - Adam's friend who is a professional wrestler- and Skate - Adam's younger kid brother.</p><h4>Max</h4><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/138782/2727338-max_thunder.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2727338\" data-ratio=\"0.10497237569061\" data-width=\"181\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 181px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:10.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/138782/2727338-max_thunder.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2727338\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 181px) 100vw, 181px\" data-width=\"181\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/13/138782/2727338-max_thunder.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/13/138782/2727338-max_thunder.png 181w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/13/138782/2727338-max_thunder.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/13/138782/2727338-max_thunder.png 181w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 181px) 100vw, 181px\" data-width=\"181\"></noscript></a></figure><p> </p><p>One of the two new characters to the game. Max is a professional wrestler and friend of Adam from Streets of Rage 1. Max is one of three characters in the series to only be playable in one game. Each game in the series has a character who was only playable one time in that game only. In Streets of Rage 1 it was Axel. In Streets of Rage 2 it's Max, and in Streets of Rage 3 it is Dr. Zan. However, all characters come together again in the best ending of Streets of Rage 3, where all of it's main playable characters appear in a slideshow along with Adam and Max. Max is the strongest character in the game with power and stamina ratings of three. He is also the slowest with 1 star in speed and jump. He also has two stars in technique for his array of grabs.</p><p>Max is far and away the strongest character in the game. He is the only character with a basic combo which can kill the Galsia enemies in just one string. He does not have the ability to vault over enemies as he is too heavy to do so, however, he has the strongest grab moves in the game. His neutral grab is a headlock which deals decent damage. However, Max's main strength comes from his aerial back and forward grabs in which he executes a series of wrestling slams. These moves take away about 3/4's of the standard health bar in just one hit. Due to this and Max taking less damage than other characters he is commonly chosen for people who want to beat the game on the hardest difficulty setting.</p><p>Max's dash attack has a decent degree of movement to it, but it does some of the least damage of any of the other dash attacks. This is the only move in Max's arsenal which has lower damage than any other characters attack of the same variety. The main use of this attack is to knock people down and get in close for a grab.</p><p>Max's neutral special is a spinning lariat which is used for AoE damage similar to what the other three characters have. His forward special is one of the hardest hitting in the game if it can connect multiple times. Max shoulder rushes his enemy and deals multiple quick flurry hits with his body weight.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/138782/2727324-megadrive-genesis-streets-of-rage-2-stage-0-3-max.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2727324\" data-ratio=\"0.6171875\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:61.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/138782/2727324-megadrive-genesis-streets-of-rage-2-stage-0-3-max.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2727324\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/13/138782/2727324-megadrive-genesis-streets-of-rage-2-stage-0-3-max.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/13/138782/2727324-megadrive-genesis-streets-of-rage-2-stage-0-3-max.jpg 1024w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/13/138782/2727324-megadrive-genesis-streets-of-rage-2-stage-0-3-max.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/13/138782/2727324-megadrive-genesis-streets-of-rage-2-stage-0-3-max.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/13/138782/2727324-megadrive-genesis-streets-of-rage-2-stage-0-3-max.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/13/138782/2727324-megadrive-genesis-streets-of-rage-2-stage-0-3-max.jpg 1024w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/13/138782/2727324-megadrive-genesis-streets-of-rage-2-stage-0-3-max.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/13/138782/2727324-megadrive-genesis-streets-of-rage-2-stage-0-3-max.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\"></noscript></a></figure><p> </p><h4>Axel</h4><p>Axel is back again in Streets of Rage 2. With a whole new slew of moves to help him this was the strongest he had been up until this point. Axel is the only character in the game with a full Technique rating of three stars. Along with a two in Power, Speed, and Stamina and a one in jump Axel is one of the most balanced characters in the game. New to Axel are the neutral and forward special moves along with the dash attack.</p><p>Axel's Technique rating is what makes him such a strong character. Axel has the strongest dash attack in the game. His famous \"Grand Upper\" has a long enough range into the air and above him that he can connect it with literally any enemy in the game, including enemies with a lot of invulnerability frames and flying enemies. Axel has a fairly weak standard combo but he makes up for it with his ability to spam his dash attacks. The only real flaw with the \"Grand Upper\" move is that while it is one sweeping motion it still registers on some characters as multiple rapid hits. The hits are so rapid that they simply count as one on most enemies. However, enemies that have a trigger to stop lengthy combos on them, like Abadede, can break out of it at any point that the computer realizes it is in a multi-hit combo. As such, Axel is the second worst character against the Round 4 and Round 5 bosses.</p><p>Axel's neutral special causes him to spin around punching everyone in a circle around him. Axel's forward special delivers a flurry of punches directly in front of him. This is a great move in most boss fights in the game as it has the ability to keep most of them pinned in it until the string finishes. Axel has the highest range upwards of any characters neutral jump attack.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/138782/2727329-streets-of-rage-2-02.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2727329\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/138782/2727329-streets-of-rage-2-02.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2727329\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-width=\"640\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/13/138782/2727329-streets-of-rage-2-02.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/13/138782/2727329-streets-of-rage-2-02.png 640w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/13/138782/2727329-streets-of-rage-2-02.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/13/138782/2727329-streets-of-rage-2-02.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/13/138782/2727329-streets-of-rage-2-02.png 640w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/13/138782/2727329-streets-of-rage-2-02.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-width=\"640\"></noscript></a></figure><p> </p><h4>Blaze</h4><p>Blaze is one of the two returning characters in the series as well as one of the two characters to appear in every game in the trilogy. Blaze intended to be the jack-of-all-trades in this game with a two-star rating on every stat. This,however, simply means that she is weaker then she was in the first game and generally makes her an after-thought compared to the other three characters. Blaze does make up for her lack of specialty with overall good mid-range moves.</p><p>Blaze's dash attack in this game causes her to do a flying somersault. This strike has hitboxes starting at the beginning of her arc which means that the first few hits can actually hit behind her. However, this is very hard to connect considering the character would need to be right behind you and you just did two movements forward, making it impossible for most of the enemies in the game to get in at that speed. Blaze's dash attack is similar to Axel's in that is has multiple hits on it.</p><p>Blaze's neutral special is just another version of her dash attack except she has no forward momentum and just stays on one place. This is used, like all other neutral specials, to clear the area around her. Blaze's forward special attacks directly in front of her. She pushes her palms forward and throws out a small ball of energy which extends from her hands. This attack is limited in range but it is fairly strong.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/138782/2727331-streets-of-rage-2-character-select.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2727331\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/138782/2727331-streets-of-rage-2-character-select.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2727331\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-width=\"640\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/13/138782/2727331-streets-of-rage-2-character-select.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/13/138782/2727331-streets-of-rage-2-character-select.jpg 640w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/13/138782/2727331-streets-of-rage-2-character-select.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/13/138782/2727331-streets-of-rage-2-character-select.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/13/138782/2727331-streets-of-rage-2-character-select.jpg 640w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/13/138782/2727331-streets-of-rage-2-character-select.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-width=\"640\"></noscript></a></figure><p> </p><h4>Skate</h4><p>Skate (Sammy in some locations) is one of the two new characters to the series. Skate is Adam from Streets of Rage 1's younger brother who is trying to help Axel and Blaze find their missing coworker. Skate is named for the fact that he is on rollerblades throughout all of his appearances. This leads to Skate having the fastest speed rating in all of the games that he is playable in. Skate is the only playable character in the series who was introduced partway through and continued to be playable for the rest of the series.</p><p>Skate is the weakest character when it comes to basic damage with a power and stamina rating of 1. Where Skate makes up for this, however, is in his Speed and Jump ratings of 3 and a 2 in technique. Although technically weaker than Blaze, a few of his easily employed grabs and specials along with a variety of other techniques put him one slot above her in character rating.</p><p>Skate is the only character who can run in Streets of Rage 2. By double tapping the forward button (the same way you would initiate a dash attack on any character) Skate starts to skate forward. This means that Skate's dash attack does not need to be entered like a fighting game combo but can be buffered so that he can run as long as he likes and attack when he feels like it. Skate was the only character in the early parts of the series to be able to run which gave him one distinct technique that no one else was capable of. This was changed in Streets of Rage 3 when everyone got a standard run.</p><p>Skate's dash attack is the worst in the game. The only real benefit of it is that it knocks the enemies down, however, it can be quite hard to position yourself properly for a good combo after landing it. Also the fact that you have to send your entire body flying forward with such a weak character means that it is easy to mess up when using this.</p><p>Skate's neutral special sees him doing a headspin on the ground and kicking out to the enemies around him. Skate has one of the best forward specials in the game. Skate jumps up into the air and does a multi-hit corkscrew attack with his entire enemy downwards in a diagonal line in front of him.</p><p>Skates strongest move in the game is his back grab neutral attack. If Skate grabs an enemy from behind and presses no directions while pressing the attack button he will jump up and sit on their shoulders piggy-back style and repeatedly punch the enemy in the back of the head. This move takes of around 1/2 of the standard life-bar, making it the strongest move which is not performed by Max.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/138782/2727332-megadrive-genesis-streets-of-rage-2-stage-0-5-skate.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2727332\" data-ratio=\"0.6171875\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:61.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/138782/2727332-megadrive-genesis-streets-of-rage-2-stage-0-5-skate.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2727332\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/13/138782/2727332-megadrive-genesis-streets-of-rage-2-stage-0-5-skate.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/13/138782/2727332-megadrive-genesis-streets-of-rage-2-stage-0-5-skate.jpg 1024w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/13/138782/2727332-megadrive-genesis-streets-of-rage-2-stage-0-5-skate.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/13/138782/2727332-megadrive-genesis-streets-of-rage-2-stage-0-5-skate.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/13/138782/2727332-megadrive-genesis-streets-of-rage-2-stage-0-5-skate.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/13/138782/2727332-megadrive-genesis-streets-of-rage-2-stage-0-5-skate.jpg 1024w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/13/138782/2727332-megadrive-genesis-streets-of-rage-2-stage-0-5-skate.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/13/138782/2727332-megadrive-genesis-streets-of-rage-2-stage-0-5-skate.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\"></noscript></a></figure><p> </p><table data-max-width=\"false\"><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\">Ability</th><th scope=\"col\">Rating</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Power</td><td><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.soronline.net/img/sor2/sor2_icon_star.gif\" /></td></tr><tr><td>Technique</td><td><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.soronline.net/img/sor2/sor2_icon_star.gif\" /><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.soronline.net/img/sor2/sor2_icon_star.gif\" /></td></tr><tr><td>Speed</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td>Jump</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td>Stamina</td><td> </td></tr></tbody></table><p> </p><h3>Streets of Rage 3</h3><p>The jump from Streets of Rage 2 to Streets of Rage 3 is perhaps the most jarring in the series. The game was significantly harder in America due to the normal mode being the equivalent of the Japanese hard mode and everyone did far less damage then they used to. Streets of Rage 3 also introduced running to every character which meant that Skate no longer had a distinct advantage over the rest of the cast. Streets of Rage 3 was also the first in the series to feature secret characters all three of whom (or two if you are playing an American copy) could be unlocked by the middle of the second stage of the game. Also new to the gray was Dr. Zan, a robotic figure who had the strength of Max but was thin, fast and had the ability to vault over people.</p><p>Another significant change was to the special system. In Streets of Rage each character had 1 special use per life which called in backup. Streets of Rage 2 introduced the traditional neutral and forward specials at the cost of health. Streets of Rage 3 uses the same system however it adds a new feature to the mix. Instead of a timer in the middle there is a small bar which ticks upwards. When the bar is filled and it says \"OK\" above it a player can perform a special without any type of health penalty. This is a change from Streets of Rage 2's system where a a missed neutral special would cost nothing, but a neutral that landed and any type of forward special would still cost health.</p><p>Weapons were changed as well. You could no longer hold onto weapons indefinitely, each weapon had a visible lifebar which greatly decreased their usefulness in the game. To make up for this, the game added a new move for each character while holding a weapon. Doing a characters normal dash attack while holding a weapon did a unique move for each character/weapon combination.</p><p>The first of the obtainable secret characters is Shiva, who was the penultimate boss of the previous game and the first boss of this game. To unlock him simply keep holding the B button after you defeat him at the end of the first level until the start of the second level. Now, if you were to lose all your lives and changed your character during the game, Shiva would be playable.</p><p>The second of the obtainable characters is Roo, the kangaroo mini-boss from the very beginning of the second level. Roo is fought alongside his master. To unlock Roo simply defeat his master first. Once his master is defeated Roo will run off and now be selectable after running out of continues as well. However, unlike Shiva, if you get a gameover and go back to the main menu again Roo will actually have a slot on the character select screen with a visible portrait and stats.</p><h4>Roo and Shiva are very limited in their abilities, however, which leads fans to very rarely count them as actual players. They are both limited in their special and weapon use which makes them almost unviable with the higher difficulty of this game.</h4><h4>Dr. Zan</h4><p>Dr. Zan is the only new playable character in the game. He is a robot who is working with Axel and Blaze to help stop Mr. X. Dr. Zan has the strongest strength stat in the game. He is as powerful as Max was in Streets of Rage 2, however, since he is smaller he is faster, he can run, and he can vault over people.</p><h4>Axel</h4><p>Axel is one of the two characters who are back for their third time in this game. Axel plays almost exactly as he did in Streets of Rage 2, however, he can now sprint. </p><h4>Blaze</h4><p>Blaze is the second of the two characters who are back for their third time in this game. Blaze plays almost exactly as she did in Streets of Rage 2, however, she can now sprint.</p><h4>Skate</h4><p>Skate is the only character to be in only two games. Out of the three returning characters Skate has sustained the most changes. He is even weaker than he was in Streets of Rage 2, his sprint is no longer unique to just him, and his forward special was drastically changes. Skate's new forward special has him rushing forward swinging his arms in a circle hitting any enemies in front of him.</p><h3>Other Games and Compilations</h3><p> </p><p> </p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/1148334-6pak.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1148334\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.43\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:143.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/1148334-6pak.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1148334\"><img alt=\" 6-Pak included many popular Genesis games, including Streets of Rage\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/1992/1148334-6pak.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/1992/1148334-6pak.jpg 300w\"><noscript><img alt=\" 6-Pak included many popular Genesis games, including Streets of Rage\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/1992/1148334-6pak.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/1992/1148334-6pak.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"></noscript></a><figcaption> 6-Pak included many popular Genesis games, including Streets of Rage</figcaption></figure><p>Initially included on the Sega Genesis 6 Pak, Streets of Rage and its sequel have been included in a variety of ports, remakes, and compilations.

However, during this offensive, Kerrigan and her contingent of Terran forces are assaulted by the Zerg, and Mengsk abandons them to their death. This infuriates Raynor, causing him to leave the rebel group by force, hijacking Mengsk\u2019s flagship, the <em>Hyperion</em>, in the process. <br/>\u00a0<br/>Raynor soon hears telepathic messages from Kerrigan in his dreams. Believing her to be alive, Raynor travels to <a data-ref-id=\"3035-271\" href=\"/char/3035-271/\" slug=\"char\">    Char</a> only to find   Kerrigan completely infested and controlled by the Zerg.

It is here were him and Fenix develop a strong friendship and a deep respect of each other. Later, Kerrigan convinces him and the Protoss that the United Earth Directorate invasion is a much grater threat to them than she is. Raynor and Fenix then kidnap Mengsk in order to gain his support in the campaign against the UED. Soon after, <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1255\" href=\"/korhal/3035-1255/\" slug=\"korhal\">    Korhal IV</a>, the throne world of the Terran Dominion is recaptured by the allied forces.

Despite the jump forward in the time period, The Old Republic is still very much a member of the KOTOR franchise, involving many of the same places, and descendants of characters you met in the KOTOR RPG's, along with possible return appearances by droids from the original games. Bioware says they aim to make story a central focus of SWOR, emphasizing it just as much in the MMORPG environment as they did in the single-player environment. The artstyle in the game has been tweaked noticeably from the previous KOTOR games, heading for a slightly more cartoony and stylized look, although not extremely so.<br />The \"Knights of\" was dropped from the title do to the MMO's focus on classes other than Jedi and Sith Force users, which, while being components of the game, will not be the sole class, or even focus of the game. Likely that's the only thing anyone will play though.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Characteristic Gameplay</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Both KOTOR games have a similar framework of exploration, conversation, and turn-based combat. The games focus heavily on story and character interaction via <a href=\"/dialogue-trees/3015-77/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-77\">dialogue trees</a>, as opposed to the heavy focus on combat and prerendered cinematics that characterizes Eastern RPGS.

Star Fox is owned and developed by <a href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-90\">Nintendo</a>. The series has seen many innovations since its inception, most prominently the development of the <a href=\"/super-fx-chip/3015-7544/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7544\">Super FX</a> chip in the first game, which powered polygonal graphics on the <a href=\"/snes/3045-9/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\">Super Nintendo</a>. The series is known as Star Wing (<a href=\"/star-fox-64/3030-19203/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19203\">Star Fox 64</a> was titled Lylat Wars) in <a href=\"/europe/3035-289/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-289\">Europe</a> due to a trademark issue. However, before the release of <a href=\"/star-fox-adventures/3030-19026/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19026\">Star Fox Adventures</a>, Nintendo bought the trademark so that future titles could share the name worldwide.</p><p>Nintendo has run a variety of Star Fox comics, some of which appeared in <i>Nintendo Power</i>.</p><h2><a href=\"/star-fox/3030-3984/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3984\">Star Fox</a></h2><p>The Star Fox series began as a forward-scrolling 3D rail shooter on the Super Nintendo. The original Star Fox featured the Super FX chip, which enabled the game the have a 3D look and feel despite the limitations of the system. The game was able to deliver polygonal objects, both flat and texture-mapped, which up until then was something that had only been seen in arcade games. Star Fox proved to be popular enough for Nintendo to create a competition centered around it. A special version of the game called Star Fox Super Weekend was made for the event. Only 2000 of these cartridges were made, rendering the item somewhat of a collector's item.</p><p>A shortened version of this game was featured in <a href=\"/warioware-smooth-moves/3030-13685/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13685\">Wario Ware: Smooth Moves</a>, which has players face off against some of the <a href=\"/bosses/3015-229/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-229\">bosses</a> from the original game.</p><h2><a href=\"/star-fox-2/3030-21650/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21650\">Star Fox 2</a></h2><p>A sequel was planned for Star Fox on the Super Nintendo, but the project was canceled before it saw a release. Star Fox 2 was said to feature numerous improvements, including a <a href=\"/split-screen-multiplayer/3015-322/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-322\">multiplayer mode</a>, the <a href=\"/landmaster-tank/3055-472/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-472\">Landmaster</a>, the rival Star Wolf team, charge shot, and all-range mode. Many of the ideas were implemented into future Star Fox titles, most prominently Star Fox 64 and Star Fox Command. A ROM of the game in beta form was dumped and released on the Internet, which featured a near-finished version of the game.</p><h2><a href=\"/star-fox-64/3030-19203/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19203\">Star Fox 64</a></h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1675/307916-star_fox_64_8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-307916\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.73421926910299\" data-width=\"301\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 301px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:73.4%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1675/307916-star_fox_64_8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-307916\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/1675/307916-star_fox_64_8.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/1675/307916-star_fox_64_8.jpg 301w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 301px) 100vw, 301px\" data-width=\"301\"></a></figure><p>The second game in the Star Fox series was released in 1997 on the <a href=\"/nintendo-64/3045-43/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-43\">Nintendo 64</a>, and is still one of the more popular games in the franchise. Star Fox 64 was the first installment to have fully spoken dialogue. It also featured new vehicles, a multiplayer mode, real 3D graphics, and new characters.

The game was released in 2005 on the GameCube, and the emphasis on flying combat returned (although the game also retained on-foot missions). The game takes place a year after the events of Adventures and follows a new threat to the Lylat System: the Aparoids (a parasitic race of aliens which consume anything in their path).</p><h2><a href=\"/star-fox-command/3030-498/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-498\">Star Fox Command</a></h2><p>Star Fox Command is the series' first handheld title, appearing on the <a href=\"/nintendo-ds/3045-52/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-52\">Nintendo DS</a> in 2006. Developed by <a href=\"/q-games-ltd/3010-649/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-649\">Q-Games</a>, Command took the original gameplay formula and put a spin on it. The game has a \"strategy\" system, in which the player maps out each character's path, and then watches them move. If a character bumps into an enemy, the gameplay turns into the more traditional flying mode (although it is not on-rails as in previous titles, instead the player has full 360-degree control). In this flying mode, the goals are usually to destroy a certain type of enemy, destroy all enemies, or destroy a mother ship. Star Fox Command introduced new ships (each character has their own ship with varying abilities), new characters (as well as old ones), and nine different endings (none of which are considered canon for the Star Fox storyline).</p><h2>Other Games</h2><p>A Star Fox game was once planned to be released on the <a href=\"/virtual-boy/3045-79/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-79\">Virtual Boy</a>, but the console's almost immediate failure killed the idea. The closest game to the tech demo of Star Fox was <a href=\"/red-alarm/3030-12612/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12612\">Red Alarm</a>, another space shooter on the Virtual Boy. The tech demo for Star Fox on the Virtual Boy was shown both at <a href=\"/e3-1995/3015-3482/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3482\">E3 1995</a> and at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show 1995. Attendees were given 3D glasses so they could watch the action on-screen in the 3D that the Virtual Boy boasted.</p><p>A Star Fox arcade game was originally planned as a companion game for Star Fox Assault, however, for reasons unknown, it was never released.</p>", "guid": "3025-329", "name": "Star Fox"}, {"description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>The video games in the Star Trek franchise are based around the television series.

The series has spanned over several films as well. The most recent film follows the characters from the original series recast. It's set in an alternate timeline.</p><p>The first game based on Star Trek was released in 1971 as a shareware BASIC text-only game. This game, simply titled, Star Trek is seen by many as an inspiration for many of the 1980s space themed games. The next year, another text-based Star Trek game, once again titled simply Star Trek, was released on the mainframe of the PDP-10. In 1979, the first non-text and first console Star Trek game, Star Trek: Phaser Strike, was released for the Microvision. The game was meant to collide with the release of Star Trek: The Motion Picture. In 1981, Begin: A Tactical Starship Simulation was released for the MS-DOS. Though, it did not have Star Trek in the title, the game took place within the Star Trek universe. The next year, the first arcade Star Trek game was release, <a href=\"/star-trek-strategic-operations-simulator/3030-13785/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13785\">Star Trek - Strategic Operations Simulator</a>. In 1985, another text based Star Trek game was release, Star Trek: The Kobayashi Alternative.

In the game, it was possible to fail every objective in the game but still complete the story. The game was also one of the first games to feature a copy protection system in which the player had to consult the instruction manual to see which galaxy they were suppose to be warp to next.

Also in 1997, <a href=\"/star-trek-generations/3030-14981/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14981\">Star Trek Generations</a> was release as the first FPS title in the Star Trek franchise.

Star Trek: Armada was the first true real-time strategy game in the Star Trek franchise and was a large success. The game became the 2nd best selling Star Trek game of all-time, just behind Star Trek 25th Anniversary.

Yet another space combat simulation game, <a href=\"/star-trek-bridge-commander/3030-16235/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16235\">Star Trek: Bridge Commander</a> was also released.

The game takes place directly after the end of the Voyager series and runs on the Quake III: Team Arena engine. 2004 was the first year to not see a Star Trek game released for computers in 10 years. However, 2004 did see the release of <a href=\"/star-trek-shattered-universe/3030-7811/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7811\">Star Trek: Shattered Universe</a> for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. Shattered Universe takes place during the original series and was universally panned by critics. 2005 was the first year without a Star Trek in 15 years. Though, 2006 would see the release of 3 new Star Trek titles. <a href=\"/star-trek-legacy/3030-7690/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7690\">Star Trek: Legacy</a> was released for the PC and Xbox 360 in order to collide with the 40th anniversary of the series. However, the game did not pay proper homage to the series becoming the next Star Trek game to be panned by critics. <a href=\"/star-trek-tactical-assault/3030-12884/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12884\">Star Trek: Tactical Assault</a> was released alongside Legacy for the PSP and DS.

However, despite the praise from critics, the game sold terribly due to a total lack of marketing.</p><h2>Star Trek Massively Multiplayer Online Game</h2><p><a href=\"/star-trek-online/3030-21810/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21810\">Star Trek Online</a> was released on February 2, 2010 by <a href=\"/cryptic-studios/3010-3766/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-3766\">Cryptic Studios</a>. It is the first MMO in the franchise. The game is set 30 years after the events in the film Star Trek Nemesis. It received mixed reviews from critics, most saying it was a decent game, albeit rushed and unpolished.</p><p>The game has two methods of play. The first is space combat that's a cross between real time, and hotkey commands. You can fly your ship yourself, fire your phasers or torpedoes (which you can buy and equip, allowing customization), and use buffs/debuffs that you unlock as you level up. You can also recruit bridge officers, allowing one tactical officer, one science officer, and one Engineering officer. These each grant you abilities to use in space as well as on the ground, which can be upgraded and customized.</p><p>The second method is beaming down to planets to take on missions, which has more traditional MMO game play. You move around from a third person perspective, and fire weapons and use abilities using hotkeys. Your bridge officers can also join you on missions, allowing you to use their abilities.</p>", "guid": "3025-330", "name": "Star Trek"}, {"description": "<p><a href=\"/capcom/3010-367/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-367\">Capcom</a>'s Street Fighter series was one of the first competitive <a href=\"/games/?sort=release_date&amp;filter_type=genre&amp;filter_value=9/\">fighting</a> game series on the market, with the original Street Fighter being released in 1987.

Capcom eventually did release a Street Fighter 3 in 1997 to mixed reception. Apart from Ryu and Ken, the third game featured all new characters. Eventually Capcom put out an iteration that added <a href=\"/chun-li/3005-267/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-267\">Chun Li</a>. but by then the damage had been done.

Beginning life as a parody of dark and gritty comic books, it was adapted into a more kid-friendly animated television series in the late 1980s and subsequently spawned a long line of merchandise such as action figures, as well as a series of theatrical feature films. The franchise has also spawned numerous games, beginning with <a href=\"/ultra-games/3010-1390/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1390\">Ultra Games's</a> <a href=\"/nes/3045-21/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-21\">NES</a> release of <a href=\"/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/3030-20790/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20790\">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a>.</p><p>The titular brothers are a quartet of turtles that, through exposure to a mutagen compound, are transformed into anthropomorphic humanoids with human intellect. They are trained in the martial arts by <a href=\"/splinter/3005-68/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-68\">Splinter</a>, a man that was likewise affected by the mutagen and transformed into an anthropomorphic rat. He raised the turtles as a father figure and named each of them after an artist of the Renaissance.</p><ul><li><a href=\"/leonardo/3005-192/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-192\">Leonardo</a> - He is the leader of the group. He wears a blue piece of cloth around his head, wields two katanas, and was named after Leonardo Da Vinci.</li><li><a href=\"/raphael/3005-121/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-121\">Raphael</a> - The more temperamental of the four, the very aggressive Raphael wields a pair of sai and is recognizable through his red mask. He was named after Raphael Sanzio.</li><li><a href=\"/donatello/3005-300/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-300\">Donatello</a> - The brains of the group, recognizable through his purple mask. He wields a bo staff and was named after Donato di Niccol\u00f2 di Betto Bardi.</li><li><a href=\"/michelangelo/3005-172/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-172\">Michelangelo</a> - The comedic turtle known for his slapstick comedy, love of pizza, and nunchaku. He wears an orange mask and was named after Michelangelo Buonarroti.</li></ul><p>The turtles' primary ally is <a href=\"/april-oneil/3005-57/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-57\">April O'Neil</a>, a television reporter they rescue and subsequently befriend. Their primary adversary is <a href=\"/shredder/3005-87/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-87\">The Shredder</a>, an evil, power-hungry ninja master who leads the <a href=\"/foot-clan/3015-6270/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6270\">Foot Clan</a>.</p><h2>Cartoons</h2><p>A new cartoon premiered in 2003 produced by 4Kids Entertainment. This new version of the turtles retold the original story of the comic with creators Peter Laird and Kevin Eastman closely overseeing the production. After the series concluded, a final animated special called Turtles Forever was produced which crossed over the 1987 cartoon turtles and the original comic turtles teaming up to defeat the 2003 version of The Shredder.</p><p>In 2009, after Peter Laird sold the rights to Viacom, a new cartoon which was developed by Nickelodeon Animation Studios premiered in 2012. This cartoon reused and referenced tropes to both versions of the previous cartoons while keeping the dark undertones of the original and IDW comics while also introducing new and previously unseen characters to the wider Ninja Turtles universe.</p><p>In 2019, a new series called Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles premiered as a original series taking place while the original Ninja Turtles were still ninjas in training. Unlike the other series before it, several tropes are upended as a means for developing the young ninja's characters (e.g. Raphael is the leader instead of Leonardo).</p><h2>Film &amp; Television</h2><p>The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have starred in several films, five live action films and one CGI film. The first live action film is meant to be an origin story for how the turtles and their master, Splinter, came to be. The first film showed how the turtles turned into their humanoid forms, as well as introducing other characters such as April O' Neil, <a href=\"/casey-jones/3005-1521/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1521\">Casey Jones</a>, and their nemesis, Shredder. The basic plot of the first film is an attempt to follow the storyline from the original comic while taking some liberties to make it appealing to fans of the comic and the cartoon. The first film was a purely independent film and ended up becoming a huge hit, which allowed for two more live action sequels.</p><p>The second live action film, <i>The Secret of the Ooze</i>, is a direct sequel to the first film and is a much more \"family-friendly\" film than the original. Despite its gritty aesthetics from the first film, <i>The Secret of the Ooze'</i>s tone gravitated closer to the Saturday morning cartoon than its comic counterpart. The second film also introduces two new mutant characters, Tokka and Rahzar, who took the place of Bebop and Rocksteady. These new characters were created because the original creator of <i>The Teenage Mutant Turtles</i>, Kevin Eastman, did not like the family-friendly direction of the second film.</p><p><i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III</i> is the last live action film in the series and focuses on a story involving time travel. After finding a strange scepter, the turtles are inadvertently transported back in time to fifteenth century Japan, where they thwart a European trader's attempt to seize power before returning to their own time.</p><p>A successor to the movies called <em>Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation</em> was made for TV to further continue the live action adventure of the turtles and introduced a fifth female turtle named Mona Lisa. The series was produced by Saban Entertainment, the same company which produced the <a href=\"/power-rangers/3025-915/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-915\"><em>Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers</em></a> series. The turtles actually crossed over into the Power Rangers In Space series in the episodes Save Our Ship and Shell Shocked.</p><p>A separate but unrelated film, <em>TMNT</em>, was made during the 2003 cartoon's run. Despite an all-star voice cast, the movie was a flop at the box office and plans for a sequel were discontinued.</p><p>A reboot of the live-action films was released in 2014 produced by Nickelodeon Studios and Platinum Dunes. The movie is an original take on the Ninja Turtles with some nods to the 1987 cartoon and the IDW comic books. The movie was a mixed success but managed to generate interest in sequels, with the second film introducing the live-action debuts of the Utrom alien warlord Krang, and fan-favorite henchmen Bebop and Rocksteady.</p>", "guid": "3025-332", "name": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"}, {"description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Tekken series began life on arcade machines in 1994 with <a href=\"/tekken/3030-10081/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10081\"> Tekken</a>, which was then brought over to the PlayStation in 1995. The game then became one of the system\u2019s flagship titles and the franchise would soon become a staple with all other future PlayStation systems, with the exception of one Game Boy Advance release, <a href=\"/tekken-advance/3030-3243/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3243\"> Tekken Advance</a>. Additionally, the original Tekken was the first <a href=\"/playstation-3/3055-1463/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1463\"> PlayStation</a> game to sell over a million units, and <a href=\"/tekken-2/3030-10387/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10387\"> Tekken 2</a> sold over 250,000 on its first day, a record at the time.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The term \"Tekken\" literally translates from <a href=\"http://japanese.about.com/library/bl50kanji5_tekken.htm\" rel=\"nofollow \"> Japanese kanji</a> to \"Iron Fist\", which is the name of the tournament in the game. The kanji for \"Tekken\" is featured in the background of each game's logo.</p><h2>Controls</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">At first glance the controls may seem basic, however the first Tekken game had a pretty advanced button mechanic for its time; utilizing complex button combinations for stronger attacks. What was unique was the fact that the game assigned one button to each limb. The default controls in the first PlayStation game were:</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">: Right Punch</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">: Left Punch</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">: Right Kick</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">: Left Kick</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The D-pad was used to maneuver the player:</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Up: Jump</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Left: Move Left</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Right: Move Right</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Down: Crouch</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">These basic controls have remained the same throughout all generations of Tekken games, as well as the basic throwing combinations of plus and plus , which all characters used. Of course, through each new game, additions were made such as \u201cside-stepping\u201d, and more button combinations were added for different characters, but the basic controls had remained unchanged. It's also worth noting that the player can assign two buttons to each shoulder button (R1, R2, L1, L2) in order to make pressing two buttons at once easier. For example, the player could assign and to one shoulder button so that when they pressed the shoulder button their character would perform a grab.</p><h2>Story</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Tekken franchise features an extensive background story with multiple endings depending on which character you complete the story/arcade mode with. However, it is usually the case that the main branch of the story depends on only one of the characters\u2019 endings from the previous game, which set the premise for the sequel games. The games plot primarily focuses on the \"dysfunctional\" Mishima/Kazama family. The other characters\u2019 stories continue differently from their previous game\u2019s endings.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">So far, the endings that have determined the main storyline are:</p><ul><li>Tekken \u2013 <a href=\"/kazuya-mishima/3005-534/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-534\"> Kazuya Mishima</a>\u2019s ending</li><li>Tekken 2 \u2013 <a href=\"/heihachi-mishima/3005-535/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-535\"> Heihachi Mishima</a>\u2019s ending</li><li>Tekken 3 \u2013 <a href=\"/jin-kazama/3005-537/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-537\"> Jin Kazama</a>\u2019s ending</li><li>Tekken 4 \u2013 Jin Kazama\u2019s ending (although Jin's ending is canon, Heihachi actually won the tournament)</li><li>Tekken 5 \u2013 Jin Ka<b>z</b>ama's ending</li><li>Tekken 6 \u2013 N/A</li></ul><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">However, just because a character does not win the tournament does not mean that their ending is not canonical. For example, in <a href=\"/feng-wei/3005-1073/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1073\"> Feng Wei</a>'s <a href=\"/tekken-5/3030-18753/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18753\"> Tekken 5</a> ending, we see that he found the scrolls that he entered the Tournament in search for. He did not win the tournament, but he did find the scrolls, making his Tekken 5 ending cinematic canon.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Note: It is Rumored that Kazuya's ending is Canon due to him being in the middle of the cover that and he is the only one that fights Devil Jin.This proves that Kazuya might have won the tournament and possibly defeats Lars, Heihachi, and Jin/Devil Jin but it is yet to be confirmed. But the Devil Orb might be apart of it as well.</p><h2>Main Story</h2><h3>Tekken</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><a href=\"/tekken/3030-10081/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10081\"> Main Article</a></p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33745/1777031-tt2_kazuya.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1777031\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.3341176470588\" data-width=\"850\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 850px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:133.4%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33745/1777031-tt2_kazuya.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1777031\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/33745/1777031-tt2_kazuya.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/3/33745/1777031-tt2_kazuya.jpg 850w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/3/33745/1777031-tt2_kazuya.jpg 719w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/33745/1777031-tt2_kazuya.jpg 479w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 479px) 100vw, 479px\" data-width=\"479\"></a></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The story starts with Heihachi Mishima, the merciless owner of the Mishima Zaibatsu conglomerate, announcing a fighting competition; \u201cKing of Iron Fist Tournament\u201d, where the winner would receive a one billion dollar cash prize.

However, when Tekken Force was attacked by a mysterious and powerful \u201c <a href=\"/ogre/3005-6012/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-6012\"> Ogre</a>\u201d, Heihachi\u2019s quest for world dominance is rekindled and seeks to use the power of the Ogre for his purpose.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">It is discovered that the Ogre is seeking out martial arts masters from around the world, and Jun Kazama had become a target. Sensing this, Jun warned Jin to run away if the Ogre ever appeared. However, on that fateful day, Jin disobeyed his mother and tried to protect her. Jin was no match for the Ogre and was knocked unconscious. As he awoke, he found that his mother was nowhere to be found.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Jin then sought out his grandfather, Heihachi Mishima, and pleaded with him to train him so as to take revenge against the Ogre. Jin trained in the art of Mishima style karate for four years, and at the age of nineteen, he had become an exceptional fighter. Heihachi then announced the \u201cKing of Iron Fist tournament 3\u201d as a means of drawing out the Ogre for Jin to take his revenge on, or so Jin thought. In reality, Heihachi was using Jin and the other competitors to lure out the Ogre and capture it.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Jin Kazama proceeded to the final round of the tournament and fought the Ogre at the summit of a great temple. As Jin gained the upper hand of the fight, the Ogre turned into it's \u201ctrue\u201d form. However, even with the Ogre's amazing power, Jin was still triumphant. Angry that Jin had killed the Ogre, Heihachi and his Tekken Force gunned down Jin. However, this triggered the <a href=\"/devil-gene/3015-1597/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1597\"> Devil Gene</a> within Jin, and Devil Jin was awakened. Jin quickly takes out Heihachi\u2019s men and then smashes Heihachi through the wall of the temple. They both start falling from the summit, however Jin then sprouts black wings and quickly breaks Heihachi\u2019s fall as he is about to hit the ground. Jin then flies off into the distance, leaving Heihachi bemused.</p><h3><b>Tekken 4</b></h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><a href=\"/tekken-4/3030-14684/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14684\"> Main Article</a></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Although Heihachi failed in capturing Ogre, Heihachi now set his sights on a new target. Two years after the King of Iron First Tournament 3, Heihachi and his scientists had started experimenting with DNA samples of Ogre that had been found. The goal was to make Heihachi immortal. The scientists attempted to splice Heihachi\u2019s DNA with the Ogre DNA, but his body lacked the devil gene required for the testing to be successful. Heihachi then attempted to search for the only person he knew alive who contained the devil gene within him; Jin Kazama. However, the search came to no avail, as there had been no signs of Jin\u2019s whereabouts since he disappeared at the end of the third King of Iron First Tournament.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">During Heihachi\u2019s investigations he had come across a picture of the charred remains of a body with protruding wing-like limbs from its back. Sure that the remains were of his son; Kazuya, he sends a team to retrieve the body from where it was being held, Mishima Zaibatsu\u2019s business rival; G-Corporation. However to Heihachi\u2019s surprise, he\u2019d learned that Kazuya had been resurrected by G-Corp and was laying waste to Heihachi\u2019s heavily armed troops as they infiltrated the base. Heihachi was infuriated.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In an attempt to lure Kazuya and Jin out, Heihachi announced the \u201cKing of Iron Fist Tournament 4\u201d. Both had taken the bait, and were proceeding through the rounds. At round 7 Kazuya and Jin were scheduled to fight, however, on his way to the 7th round, Jin was ambushed and overpowered by Heihachi\u2019s men. Jin was taken prisoner, and Kazuya was named winner by default. In the final round, Kazuya was finally able to fight against Heihachi. After a grueling battle, Heihachi had ended up being victorious yet again, however instead of killing Kazuya, Heihachi took him to where Jin was being held captive; the Hon-Maru dojo.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In the Hon-Maru Dojo, Jin had been chained up by a special metal that absorbed his powers. Seeing this, the Devil takes over Kazuya\u2019s mind again and telepathically sends Heihachi flying out the room. Devil Kazuya then attempted to steal Jin\u2019s devil gene, and make himself more powerful. However, Jin Kazama was able to stop this using his own will, and in confusion, Kazuya regains control of his own body. Kazuya then realizes the potential of the Devil\u2019s power and decides to kill Jin to absorb his devil gene. Kazuya telepathically awakens Jin, who, now enraged, then charges towards him.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After an exhausting battle, Jin emerges the winner and Heihachi uses this opportunity to attack the fatigued Jin. However, Jin was still able to overpower Heihachi and became more infuriated the more the devil gene took over his mind. Jin was about to deliver a fatal blow until he saw a vision of Jun Kazama. Out of love for his mother, he releases Heihachi. Black wings sprout from Jin\u2019s back and he flies off making a huge hole in Hon-Maru\u2019s roof.</p><h3><b>Tekken 5</b></h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><a href=\"/tekken-5/3030-18753/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18753\"> Main Article</a></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">See also - <a href=\"/tekken-5-dark-resurrection/3030-11606/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11606\"> Tekken 5: Dark Resurrection</a></p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9170/536108-367px_jinpachi1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-536108\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.6321525885559\" data-width=\"367\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 367px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:163.2%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9170/536108-367px_jinpachi1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-536108\"><img alt=\"Jinpachi Mishima, the final boss in Tekken 5\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 392px) 100vw, 392px\" data-width=\"392\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/9170/536108-367px_jinpachi1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/9170/536108-367px_jinpachi1.jpg 367w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Jinpachi Mishima, the final boss in Tekken 5\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/9170/536108-367px_jinpachi1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/9170/536108-367px_jinpachi1.jpg 367w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 392px) 100vw, 392px\" data-width=\"392\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Jinpachi Mishima, the final boss in Tekken 5</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Moments after the the victory of Jin Kazama over Kazuya MIshima and Heihachi Mishima, Jin is beginning his devil transformation.

Sierra On-Line was a small company in Oakhurst at the time and were known primarily for developing adventure games. \u00a0After the success of King\u2019s Quest, Murphy and Crowe thought that it would be really great to create a humorous science-fiction adventure game based on the trials of an intergalactic janitor. The games parodied both science fiction properties such as Star Wars and Star Trek, as well as pop-culture phenomena from McDonald's to Microsoft. The series featured a silly sense of humor heavily reliant on puns and wacky storylines. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-861\" href=\"/roger-wilco/3005-861/\" slug=\"roger-wilco\">     Roger Wilco</a>, a perpetual loser, is often depicted as the underdog who repeatedly saves the universe (often by accident) - only to be either ignored or punished for violating minor regulations in the process.<br/>\u00a0<br/><b>Scott Murphy comments:\u00a0</b><br/> \"Sierra was in a mindset where everything was medieval and it was all fairly serious. I wanted to do a game that was more fun. We even liked the idea of 'fun death'! I mean, if the player is gonna die or fail, they should at least get a laugh out of it. So we came up with the idea of making death amusing. Let's face it; most adventure games involve a good deal of frustration for the player. But we felt that if we made failure fun, to an extent, you might have players actually going back and looking for new ways to die, just to see what happens!\"\u00a0<br/><br/><b> Mark Crowe notes:</b>\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\"We wanted to do two things for the player. One, we wanted him to feel as if he were in a movie, where he could just sort of kick back and enjoy the scenery. We also wanted the player to feel as if he really was the character on the screen.\"<br/> <br/><h2>Games</h2> <h3><a data-ref-id=\"3030-5925\" href=\"/space-quest-i-roger-wilco-in-the-sarien-encounter/3030-5925/\" slug=\"space-quest-i-roger-wilco-in-the-sarien-encounter\"> <b> </b><b>      Space Quest: The Sarien Encounter<br/></b></a></h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9408/708635-sq1vgafront.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-708635\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0\"><a  href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9408/708635-sq1vgafront.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-708635\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/9408/708635-sq1vgafront.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/9408/708635-sq1vgafront.jpg 0w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 0px) 100vw, 0px\" data-width=\"0\"></a></figure>in the game, you play a cowardly janitor who manages to escape destruction from the evil Sariens because you are asleep at your post.

Space Quest III chronicled the adventures of Roger Wilco (with this being the first game where he was actually given a name, as opposed to being namable by the player) as he rushed to save the Two Guys from Andromeda from the evil clutches of their competitors, ScummSoft. It had the most critical acclaim of any Sierra product to that date, including the 1989 SPA Excellence in Software Award, Best Fantasy Role Playing Adventure Program, Best PC VGA Graphics from Game Player's Magazine, Computer Game of the Month, August/September 1989, Game Player's Magazine, and Excellence in Musical Achievement Award, Computer Gaming World.\u00a0\u00a0<br/><br/><br/> <h3><a data-ref-id=\"3030-8024\" href=\"/space-quest-iv-roger-wilco-and-the-time-rippers/3030-8024/\" slug=\"space-quest-iv-roger-wilco-and-the-time-rippers\"> <b> </b><b>   Space Quest IV: Roger Wilco and the Time Rippers<br/></b></a></h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15568/610262-sq4front.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-610262\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.2428571428571\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:124.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15568/610262-sq4front.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-610262\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/15568/610262-sq4front.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/15568/610262-sq4front.jpg 980w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1/15568/610262-sq4front.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/15568/610262-sq4front.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/15568/610262-sq4front.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/15568/610262-sq4front.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/15568/610262-sq4front.jpg 980w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1/15568/610262-sq4front.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/15568/610262-sq4front.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/15568/610262-sq4front.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure>The fourth game was released in 1991, and later re-released in CD-ROM talkie version in 1992. It was one of the first CD-ROM games on the market and one of the first SVGA ones as well. The game was about Roger's trip through time; specifically, through past and future instalments of the franchise, including travelling back to the original Space Quest, and into the (fictional) future entry Space Quest X: Latex Babes of Estros. The primary focus of the plot, however, is a fictional future game entitled Space Quest XII: Vohaul's Revenge II, in which a computerized copy of the mind of twice-defeated villain Sludge Vohaul takes over the master control computer of Roger's home planet Xenon, and promptly conquers the planet, rendering it a post-apocalyptic wasteland.<br/>\u00a0<br/><a data-ref-id=\"3040-22092\" href=\"/gary-owens/3040-22092/\" slug=\"gary-owens\">            Gary Owens</a> provided the voice of the narrator, who added a lot of colour and depth to the scene. With the \"talkie\" version, players could click around the world and often times the narrator would explain the object or scene. in one such example:\u00a0<br/><br/> \"\"Now where am I?\" You wonder aloud to nonexistent auditory organs. \"This place sure looks homey...HEY WAIT! This looks just like Xenon. IT IS XENON! It's...it's...it's really a pile.\" Along with the changes induced by an armed conflict, the city looks different, more modern, with a heavy dash of post-disaster seasoning. After casually glancing at the status line, you happen to notice that you're in Space Quest XII. What's happened? Who was that guy with the overdeveloped hairdryer? Why did you let yourself get talked into jumping into some strange, shimmering hole? Why are you talking to yourself? These strange and intriguing questions will quickly be forgotten, with barely an electron stirred in that well-armored orb atop your shoulders \" --\u00a0<b>Narrator, as Roger first appears in SQ12\u00a0</b><br/><br/> \u00a0After the programming was complete, Scott Murphy told an interviewer, \"We won't be doing another Space Quest; that's not to say that there won't be another game in the series, it's just that we won't be doing it. Although we have no solid ideas of what type of game we'd like to do next, we've lived with Roger Wilco a long time now, and though we like him a lot, we're ready for a break.\" Fans across the world were upset at this news, but Mark Crowe, the other Guy from Andromeda, was not about to give up programming games in the Space Quest series.\u00a0<br/><br/> <h3><a data-ref-id=\"3030-12261\" href=\"/space-quest-v-the-next-mutation/3030-12261/\" slug=\"space-quest-v-the-next-mutation\"> <b> </b><b>  Space Quest V: The Next Mutation\u00a0</b></a> \u00a0</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15568/610293-sq5front.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-610293\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.2489795918367\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:124.9%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15568/610293-sq5front.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-610293\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/15568/610293-sq5front.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/15568/610293-sq5front.jpg 980w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1/15568/610293-sq5front.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/15568/610293-sq5front.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/15568/610293-sq5front.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/15568/610293-sq5front.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/15568/610293-sq5front.jpg 980w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1/15568/610293-sq5front.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/15568/610293-sq5front.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/15568/610293-sq5front.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure>The game featured high-resolution, colorful graphics and played like a comic book, complete with word bubbles. It was the first of the Space Quest series to be programmed by only one of the Two Guys from Andromeda. The plot was as whimsical and funny as an original Star Trek episode and covered Roger's (accidental) rise to the rank of Captain... of a garbage scow. Though the slapstick sarcasm of Scott Murphy was greatly missed, Space Quest 5 became one of the most loved adventure games of all time.

The graphics and sound made the game look like a cartoon. Roger Wilco returns to his old uniform after being stripped (literally) of his rank and demoted back to janitor. The plot advances as an attempt on his life fails and one of his friends is killed instead. Released in 1995, this would be the last of the Space Quest series, making it unfortunate that the ending deliberately draws attention to the plot threads that have not been resolved, at the time intended as a humourous semi-cliffhanger.<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/><br/><h2>Additional Sequel attempts\u00a0</h2> Development of Space Quest VII was underway in 1996 when Sierra released The Space Quest Collection, which consisted of Space Quest I through 6 and included a brief trailer of a new game, which consisted of 3D footage of Roger Wilco strapping a giant rocket to his back and using it to push himself forward on roller skates in a scene reminiscent of Wile E. Coyote). Supposedly, the title was going to be \"Space Quest VII: The Return to Roman Numerals\", referencing the fact that an error had resulted in the previous game being named \"Space Quest 6\" instead of \"Space Quest VI\". Little was released regarding story line, although there was speculation that the game would introduce a multiplayer aspect. Scott Murphy said during development that Space Quest VII would contain some 3D elements, but would not require the use of a 3D accelerator card.\u00a0<br/> \u00a0\u00a0<br/>Due to poor sales of Grim Fandango, a high-profile adventure game by LucasArts, there was a perception that humorous adventure games were no longer viable, so when Vivendi Games took over Sierra, Space Quest VII was canceled.<br/><br/> Another attempt at creating a new Space Quest was announced on February 7, 2002. It was being developed by Escape Factory for the Microsoft Xbox video game console. Development proceeded for almost a year and a half before the project was cancelled. According to Space Quest 6 designer Josh Mandel, the SQVII designers were forbidden from using story elements from the original Space Quest games or from even playing the games. This is disputable, since other sources claimed the developers had played the games before. Website FYI.com, also claimed that this \"gutted\" SQVII would not have been an adventure game at all and would have been released only on game console platforms such as the Xbox rather than the PC. Since then the Vivendi's Product Manager Bruce Goodwill, has confirmed that the title was going to be released only on console platforms.\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/> The game was planned as a departure from the main Space Quest series, rumors it starred a new character named \"Wilger\", although Roger Wilco was playable (as seen in a production video). Though it would have maintained a comedic theme in space, no plan was made to connect it to the original series. It was cancelled around 2003. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/><h2>Collections</h2><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>The Space Quest Saga (1993) \u2013 This collection contained games I (VGA remake), II, III and IV (floppy disk version).</li><li>The Space Quest 15th Anniversery Collector's Edition (1994) \u2013 Released for Sierra's 15th anniversary, this contained games I-V &amp; Roger Wilco's Spaced Out Game Pack, plus a video featuring the Two Guys from Andromeda and a complete history of the game series.

The book is similar to Peter Spear's The King's Quest Companion and The Official Uncensored Leisure Suit Larry Bedside Companion. The first edition covered the first four games, and the second added the fifth game. It was written from the perspective of Roger Wilco sending journals on disks back into the past, so that his adventures could be made into computer games so that his great grand parents (x-times removed) would have a chance to meet each other and fall in love through their mutual love of the games. Thus by inspiring the game designers to create the games, he insured his own future existence. Each story began with Roger's daydreams and his fantasies of marrying Cornucopia Agricorp and later Beatrice Wankmeister.\u00a0<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13157/1329985-comic_frontcover.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1329985\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.5520408163265\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:155.2%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13157/1329985-comic_frontcover.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1329985\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/13157/1329985-comic_frontcover.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/13157/1329985-comic_frontcover.jpg 980w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/13157/1329985-comic_frontcover.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/13157/1329985-comic_frontcover.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/13157/1329985-comic_frontcover.jpg 980w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/13157/1329985-comic_frontcover.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a></figure>  The other was The Official Guide To Roger Wilco's Space Adventures by Jill Champion. It is similar to her The Official Book of Police Quest. It came in two editions as well. The book contains two interviews with Roger Wilco (one just after events of SQ4, and the other after SQV). The novels themselves are written as Roger's running monologues during his adventures.\u00a0<br/><br/> Adventure Comics (a division of Malibu Comics) released three issues in 1992 of a comic based on Space Quest I under the name The Adventures of Roger Wilco. The first was written by John Shaw and was in full colour. The other two were written by Paul O'Connor and were black and white.

This game put the player behind the controls of a helicopter in a simple <a href=\"/top-down-perspective/3015-788/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-788\">top-down</a> shooter, and has players flying around a series of islands, searching for factories to destroy. The inter-dependency and generative nature of these factories, coupled with Wright's enjoyment of creating new maps for this game, gave birth to the driving desire to produce a city building simulation, since he found the act of creating new levels more enjoyable than playing the game itself.</p><h2><a href=\"/simcity/3030-15035/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15035\">SimCity</a></h2><p>The first game born from this desire to create was the original SimCity, initially developed and released for the <a href=\"/commodore-64/3045-14/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-14\">Commodore 64</a> and later the <a href=\"/amiga/3045-1/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-1\">Amiga</a>, <a href=\"/mac/3045-17/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-17\">Macintosh</a>, and <a href=\"/pc/3045-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a> in 1989. SimCity provided the player with two options to start out; They could become the <a href=\"/mayor/3015-5846/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5846\">mayor</a> of a new city beginning from one of several stages of development, or they could take the role as the mayor of one several existing cities though a variety of scenarios involving situations such as recovering from severe boredom, traffic congestion, severe crime or natural disaster. The ultimate point of the game was to build and maintain a self-sustaining city, with a functional network of <a href=\"/police/3015-1011/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1011\">police</a> and fire departments to handle crime and emergencies, and a happy and growing population of citizens willing to pay taxes to support the city's infrastructure of roads and industrial sectors which produce the majority of jobs. As the size of the city increased, so did the responsibilities of the player to maintain its various problems, and only the best player able to multitask effectively could handle all of the various issues at one time.</p><h2><a href=\"/simcity-2000/3030-13760/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13760\">SimCity 2000</a></h2><p>With SimCity still being Maxis' best selling product despite the release of several other games along the \"Sims\" line (<a href=\"/simant-the-electronic-ant-colony/3030-15236/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15236\">SimAnt</a>, <a href=\"/simearth-the-living-planet/3030-250/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-250\">SimEarth</a>, etc), the decision was made to produce a new SimCity title, designed to take advantage of recent hardware advances. Released in its first incarnation on the PC in 1993, SimCity 2000 represented a significant step forward in the graphical and technical standards of the franchise, and the game was ultimately so successful that its presentation and complexity have been used as the basis for its <a href=\"/sequel/3015-3178/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3178\">sequels</a>. SimCity 2000 diverged from the standard top-down presentation of the original and provided players with a dimetric camera position that could be rotated around four times to present different perspectives, as well as zoomed in on twice. Additionally the game provided much more realistic terrain, able to provide construction surfaces of different elevations as well as subterranean layers that could be used to run subway lines and water pipes through mountains and beneath city streets. The game also provided many new types of services and facilities that could be constructed, like <a href=\"/prison/3035-420/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-420\">prisons</a>, <a href=\"/school/3035-1438/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1438\">schools</a>, <a href=\"/library/3035-963/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-963\">libraries</a>, <a href=\"/museum/3035-1295/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1295\">museums</a>, and <a href=\"/hospital/3035-1187/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1187\">hospitals</a>, as well as many structures built specifically to improve the environment and the happiness of citizens, like <a href=\"/zoo/3035-1551/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1551\">zoos</a>, <a href=\"/stadium/3035-3609/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-3609\">stadiums</a>, marinas, and <a href=\"/park/3035-2094/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2094\">parks</a>. New types of roads and methods of transportation could be constructed as well, like highways, <a href=\"/bus-depot/3035-2555/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2555\">bus depots</a>, <a href=\"/subway/3035-3041/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-3041\">subways</a>, <a href=\"/airport/3035-1242/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1242\">airports</a>, and <a href=\"/rail-track/3055-1259/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1259\">train tracks</a>, and the game also allowed for nine different types of <a href=\"/power-station/3035-2786/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2786\">power plants</a> to be built, including wind turbines, natural gas, and hydroelectric dams, as well as more contemporary and hypothetical power sources, like nuclear power, fusion power and microwave power, which have the added danger that they might create massive disaster scenarios through their malfunction. Aside from all that, the game had a significantly improved tax and budget management system, allowing the user to tax individual zones (residential industrial, commercial) at different rates, issue ordinances that would increase or decrease profits from taxes and affect citizen happiness. Finally, SimCity 2000 was the first SimCity game to make use of the query tool, which allowed the player to see detailed information about whatever tile they clicked on while using the tool, proving an invaluable asset for detailed management of particular city zones.</p><p>SimCity 2000 grew so popular that it spawned a collection of other products, all designed to interface or otherwise communicate with the core title in some way. The <a href=\"/simcity-2000-urban-renewal-kit/3030-15184/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15184\">Urban Renewal Kit</a> allowed users to produce their own building tiles to replace pre-existing game assets. <a href=\"/simcopter/3030-10985/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10985\">SimCopter</a> and <a href=\"/streets-of-simcity/3030-10616/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10616\">Streets of SimCity</a> provided the unprecedented ability to convert the 2D maps of SimCity 2000 into 3D environments and back again, allowing the player to explore and affect their cities from a first- or third-person perspective, and put them back into SimCity 2000 to observe the changes that occurred during their experience. This wasn't always a beneficial experience as if the player happened to destroy a nuclear or fusion power plant in SimCopter, the resulting explosion would completely obliterate their city, and upon loading their level back into SimCity 2000, they would find nothing but charred ruins.</p><h2><a href=\"/simcity-3000/3030-10733/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10733\">SimCity 3000</a></h2><p>Released in 1999, SimCity 3000 kept the perspective of its predecessor but significantly upped the level of detail on building sprites, often using pre-rendered 3D assets as sprites for some of the larger buildings. This iteration of the series introduced many new concepts, such as changing land value, waste management, real-world land landmarks and monuments (the Parthenon, Empire State Building, Notre Dame, etc), personal assistants (called Advisors), petitioning citizens, and special business deals that generate a large amount of money at the cost of significant drops in land value and demand for local business as well as increases in crime and pollution. Additionally the player can manage <a href=\"/farming/3015-614/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-614\">agriculture</a> and farming if they wish, as well as negotiate deals with mayors of neighboring cities to sell or purchase water, electricity, or waste management services. Lastly, the game introduced the use of the News Ticker, which scrolls the bottom of the screen displaying information the player might need to see about a variety of happenings within the city, and which also provided to the player with a general overview of his or her city by the seriousness of the headlines appearing on it.</p><p>Like the previous installment, SimCity 3000 provided users with an application to modify the existing game assets, called the Building Architect Tool, which allowed players to make use of a <a href=\"/lego/3055-556/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-556\">block or Lego</a> like interface to construct new building sprites to replace or add to the game's library of constructable buildings. SimCity 3000 was also heavily modified to function on the <a href=\"/nintendo-ds/3045-52/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-52\">Nintendo DS</a>, as <a href=\"/simcity-ds/3030-17114/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17114\">SimCity DS</a>, which made heavy use of the stylus and <a href=\"/microphone/3055-258/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-258\">microphone</a> to great effect, for example blowing into the microphone to put out fires or using the stylus to fire missiles from a <a href=\"/military-base/3035-1996/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1996\">military base</a> at an attacking <a href=\"/ufo/3055-611/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-611\">UFO</a> or monster.</p><h2><a href=\"/simcity-4/3030-4736/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4736\">SimCity 4</a></h2><p>The most complex (some would say \"complete\") version of SimCity yet, SimCity 4 improves further on the graphical and technical depth of the series by changing some of the fundamental core mechanics of the series to allow for greater scope and scale. Unlike its predecessors, SimCity 4 uses a completely 3D engine to display its graphics, the minority of which are fully polygonal 3D assets. The majority of small buildings are sprites which appear as alpha-mapped textures applied to billboards (planar polygonal surfaces with their surface normal flipped to face the camera), and the larger buildings in the game are composed of very low-polygon models with detailed textures to show windows, etc. Additionally, while SimCity 2000 and 3000 used a dimetric perspective, SimCity 4 switched to a trimetric orthographic projection in lieu of the many changes. Aside from graphical improvements, the gameplay of SimCity has changed significantly with this fourth iteration as well. No longer are players simply dropped into a city to start with, as the game has been expanded significantly, placing cities within sections of land called regions, which are in turn divided into segments. Each segment can be one of three sizes, ranging from 1 to 4 kilometers on a side. It is these segments which can be developed into a city, and the player can manage over one or more segments simultaneously if they so wish, eventually covering the entire region with dependent cities that function in junction with one another. When the player initially selects a region to develop, the game shifts into one of three modes, each of which provide the player with different tools and game mechanics with which to interact with the world:</p><p>\u2022 <a href=\"/god-mode/3015-28/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-28\">God Mode</a> - Allows the player to terraform the various terrain, raising and lowering mountains and plains, calling down disasters to affect the landscape, creating lakes and whatnot. \u2022 Mayor Mode - The core of SimCity gameplay where the player actually does most of the work. In Mayor Mode, most of the terraforming tools are disabled, and manipulating the landscape with the few tools that are available is very expensive. \u2022 My Sim - This mode of play allows players to import their characters from The Sims and drop them into a city of their choice. This mode is very useful for letting players observe citizen's needs in their cities by querying their Sims' feedback on life in the city.</p><p>Other than the significant changes in how players start and manage their cities in the game, SimCity 4 changed the way in which education and medicine is distributed, supplied new landmarks, provided a new industrial zone for agriculture and farming, automatically aligned zones towards roads, changed the status of buildings depending on the finances of their occupants and re-classifying them depending on this and other factors, simulated urban decay and gentrification, allowed for buildings to be constructed on sloping terrain, provided several new disasters including volcanoes and tsunamis, and allowed users to play during the night.</p><p>Like SimCity 3000, before it, SimCity 4 also featured a Building Architect Tool, but was far more advanced and comprehensive than the previous iteration of the software. Additionally, an expansion pack, Rush Hour, was released. Rush Hour added two new disasters, new types of roads, made changes to public transportation, query the routes of individual <a href=\"/sims/3015-1631/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1631\">Sims</a> as they move to and from work (thus allowing the player to simplify roads and reduce traffic), and most importantly, introduced U-Drive-It, which allowed players to take direct control of vehicles and drive or fly them around the city. U-Drive-It offered both mission based scenarios as well as a free driving mode.</p><h2><a href=\"/simcity-societies/3030-1628/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1628\">SimCity Societies</a></h2><p>The latest iteration of the franchise is less of a city-simulator then it is an attempt at producing a a social-engineering simulator. Developed by <a href=\"/tilted-mill-entertainment/3010-1525/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1525\">Tilted Mill Entertainment</a>, SimCity Societies was an extremely simplified SimCity game, which focused more on establishing an a successful overall society rather than producing a self-sustaining city. The societies capable of being established are Authoritarian, Capitalist, Contemplative (spiritual), Cyberpunk, Fun (entertainment), Industrial, Romantic, Spooky, Small Town (rustic), and Normal (no specific societal values). The game features no ordinance and tax system other than the basic daily income from the city's working population, provides four types of transportation options, has players place individual buildings rather than self-developing zones, and focuses on the collection of several types of social energies, which govern the path in which the player's society develops.</p><p>While SimCity Societies received generally poor scores, it apparently did well enough to warrant the development of an expansion pack. <a href=\"/simcity-societies-destinations/3030-22080/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-22080\">SimCity Societies: Destinations</a> will provide new buildings, new special Sims with new behaviors, more transportation options, and tourism functionality.</p>", "guid": "3025-354", "name": "SimCity"}, {"description": "<p>The first Silent Scope game was released in arcades in 1999. Developed by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-87\" href=\"/konami-corporation/3010-87/\" slug=\"konami-corporation\">Konami</a>, the machine garnered popularity by having a mounted <a data-ref-id=\"3055-67\" href=\"/sniper-rifle/3055-67/\" slug=\"sniper-rifle\">sniper rifle</a> that players would look through in order to snipe out various targets. Many consider the franchise to be the most accurate sniper simulation to-date.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Gameplay was similar to other <a data-ref-id=\"3015-169\" href=\"/on-rails/3015-169/\" slug=\"on-rails\">on-rails</a> shooters such as <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20519\" href=\"/ghost-squad/3030-20519/\" slug=\"ghost-squad\">Ghost Squad</a> or <a data-ref-id=\"3025-273\" href=\"/time-crisis/3025-273/\" slug=\"time-crisis\">Time Crisis</a>, however, the scope added a bit of welcome variety to the genre. Player would look through the scope, which had a small screen that showed a zoomed in view of wherever they were aiming on the main screen. In order to play successfully, players would have to look away from the scope to find their next target, aim their gun in that direction, and look through the scope to get an accurate <a data-ref-id=\"3015-85\" href=\"/headshot/3015-85/\" slug=\"headshot\">headshot</a>. Players had to be quick however, as there was an active timer at the top that would only go up every time you got a successful kill.</p><h2>Ports</h2><p>After gaining so much popularity in the arcades, the first game was ported to the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-37\" href=\"/dreamcast/3045-37/\" slug=\"dreamcast\">Dreamcast</a> in 2000. This port consisted of you moving an on screen cursor and holding a button to zoom in, creating a representation of what you would have seen in the arcade game's scope. Oddly enough, the game didn't support <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2354\" href=\"/light-gun/3015-2354/\" slug=\"light-gun\">light guns</a> and there wasn't any sniper rifle accessory released for it. There was one light gun released for the Dreamcast, called the Bio Gun, which got around this limitation by having a \"Silent Scope\" switch on it, however, this simply let you move the on-screen cursor using the D-pad on the side of the gun, and let you shoot with the gun's trigger, making it not that different of an experience from simply playing with a controller. The same version was also ported to the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-19\" href=\"/playstation-2/3045-19/\" slug=\"playstation-2\">Playstation 2</a></p><h2>Sequels</h2><p>After the success of the first game, Konami released <a data-ref-id=\"3030-16423\" href=\"/silent-scope-2-dark-silhouette/3030-16423/\" slug=\"silent-scope-2-dark-silhouette\">Silent Scope 2: Dark Silhouette</a> for Arcades in 2001. The game was fairly similar, and added improved graphics. It was ported to the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-19\" href=\"/playstation-2/3045-19/\" slug=\"playstation-2\">Playstation 2</a> later that year. in 2002, Konami also released <a data-ref-id=\"3030-4304\" href=\"/silent-scope-3/3030-4304/\" slug=\"silent-scope-3\">Silent Scope 3</a> as an <a data-ref-id=\"3015-5670\" href=\"/platform-exclusive/3015-5670/\" slug=\"platform-exclusive\">exclusive</a> for the Playstation 2, however it was still just like previous home console versions and did not feature any light gun support.</p><h2>Silent Scope Complete</h2><p>Many would call 2004's <a data-ref-id=\"3030-1580\" href=\"/silent-scope-complete/3030-1580/\" slug=\"silent-scope-complete\">Silent Scope Complete</a> for the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-32\" href=\"/xbox/3045-32/\" slug=\"xbox\">Xbox</a> the most accurate port of Silent Scope. Not only did it feature all three Silent Scope games, but it also featured a sniper light gun controller, which was a first for the series on home consoles. The sniper rifle light gun that worked with the game did not have a built-in screen on the scope like the arcade versions did, but instead had a sensor that would sense when you put your eye up to the scope, which would switch the view in-game to \"zoomed\" mode. There was also an option to shut this off, letting you manually switch to zoomed mode by hitting the B-button.</p><h2>Series' Death</h2><p>After the release of Silent Scope 3, there haven't been any new Silent Scope games coming out. Many cite this as an example of how Arcade games are becoming less and less relevant in modern gaming. While that topic is up for debate, it's not very hard to see that the Silent Scope series has died alongside the Arcades, and is a good example of an original and noteworthy light gun shooter.</p>", "guid": "3025-355", "name": "Silent Scope"}, {"description": "<h2>Overview</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/16944/1276830-k_toyama.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1276830\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 180px\" data-ratio=\"1.3333333333333\" data-width=\"180\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:133.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/16944/1276830-k_toyama.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1276830\"><img alt=\"The creator of Silent Hill. \" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/16944/1276830-k_toyama.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/16944/1276830-k_toyama.png 180w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px\" data-width=\"180\"></a><figcaption>The creator of Silent Hill. </figcaption></figure><p>The Silent Hill franchise begun on the <a href=\"/playstation/3045-22/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-22\">PlayStation</a> in 1999, created by <a href=\"/keiichirou-toyama/3040-63403/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-63403\">Keiichirou Toyama</a>. During the development of the first Silent Hill game, developer <a href=\"/konami-corporation/3010-87/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-87\">Konami</a> was looking to mimic the success that <a href=\"/capcom/3010-367/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-367\">Capcom</a> had gained with the <a href=\"/resident-evil/3025-397/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-397\">Resident Evil</a> series, which is quite evident in the franchise's first installment, but Silent Hill quickly evolved into something dramatically more emotional and moving.</p><p>The series has become well known for its haunting music and gripping stories, and these very factors have set it apart from other horror franchises.</p><h2>Storytelling</h2><p>The stories often revolve around the main characters' conflicted emotions of guilt, portrayed as perverse creatures, blood stained walls or horrifying environments, and the torture of the twisted residents of <a href=\"/silent-hill/3035-67/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-67\">Silent Hill</a>. Silent Hill has always relied heavily on moving storytelling, and the stories told in each game are much more of a core element of the games rather than something hastily added to the graphics and gameplay. Unlike many game franchises, the Silent Hill games rarely make overt connections between its different installments, and there is no obvious overarching story that progresses through the sequels, though a variety of small and large connections can be made between the different games' plots.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Silent Hill has stayed close to the traditional <a href=\"/survival-horror/3015-4801/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4801\">survival horror</a> game make-up which relies heavily on fixed camera angles and engrossing puzzles instead of fast paced combat. <a href=\"/melee/3015-444/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-444\">Melee combat</a> or pure evasion of enemies have been dominant gameplay mechanics in all of the Silent Hill games, and in combat the available weaponry usually consists of more commonplace items such as baseball bats, golf clubs and metal pipes. As in most survival horror games, strategy, as well as item conservation, play a large role in Silent Hill, and both are concepts which complements the slower ace and thought-provoking storytelling. With the exception of <a href=\"/silent-hill-4-the-room/3030-6328/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6328\">Silent Hill 4: the Room</a>, all of the games take place in the actual town of Silent Hill. The fourth game strayed slightly from the staple gameplay and location of the series in an attempt to innovate the franchise, but there are still strong connections to the eponymous town with in the plot. Early reviews praised the game for its first person elements and haunting settings, but it was eventually seen as a setback for the series when compared to the success of <a href=\"/resident-evil-4/3030-1578/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1578\">Resident Evil 4</a>.</p><p>The fifth game of the franchise, <a href=\"/silent-hill-homecoming/3030-20636/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20636\">Silent Hill: Homecoming</a>, was developed by the American based team The Collective, that merged into <a href=\"/double-helix-games/3010-6585/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6585\">Double Helix Games</a>, instead of the usual Japanese development team <a href=\"/team-silent/3010-757/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-757\">Team Silent</a>. Homecoming was an attempt at returning to the original Silent Hill formula, but was at the same time attempting to advance the combat mechanics. This installment also gave the player the opportunity to select responses in conversations during certain encounters in the game.</p><h2>Game Developers</h2><p>The first four Silent Hill games were developed by Konami's <a href=\"/team-silent/3010-757/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-757\">Team Silent</a>, but after the completion of <a href=\"/silent-hill-4-the-room/3030-6328/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6328\">Silent Hill 4: The Room</a>, the team dissolved and the members moved on to other projects. <a href=\"/akira-yamaoka/3040-40927/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-40927\">Akira Yamaoka</a> was the only Team Silent member who continued with the franchise as the series' composer, but in 2009 he left Konami to join <a href=\"/grasshopper-manufacture-inc/3010-2188/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2188\">Grasshopper Manufacture</a>. In response to the dissolution of Team Silent, Konami announced that they would appoint other companies to develop the succeeding Silent Hill titles, while they remain as publisher for the franchise. This was when Konami stopped numbering the newer games.</p><p><a href=\"/silent-hill-0rigins/3030-14392/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14392\">Silent Hill: Origins</a> and <a href=\"/silent-hill-shattered-memories/3030-25707/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-25707\">Shattered Memories</a> were developed by <a href=\"/climax-group-the/3010-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2267\">Climax</a>, <a href=\"/silent-hill-homecoming/3030-20636/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20636\">Silent Hill: Homecoming</a> by <a href=\"/double-helix-games/3010-6585/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6585\">Double Helix</a>, and <a href=\"/silent-hill-downpour/3030-30645/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-30645\">Silent Hill: Downpour</a> by <a href=\"/vatra-games/3010-7056/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-7056\">Vatra Games</a>. These new titles were not as well received as their predecessors and they continued to decline in sales and popularity. Many fans criticized these games for not having the same visual style and feel as the first four Silent Hill games.</p><h2>Film Adaptations</h2><h3>Silent Hill</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1537859-silenthillposter.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1537859\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 400px\" data-ratio=\"1.4825\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:148.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1537859-silenthillposter.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1537859\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/6/62890/1537859-silenthillposter.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/6/62890/1537859-silenthillposter.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 431px) 100vw, 431px\" data-width=\"431\"></a></figure><p>A movie adaptation of <i>Silent Hill</i> was released in 2006 and had Akira Yamaoka listed as one of the producers. The film incorporated elements from the first three games, but then remained closest to those of the first game. One major change was changing Harry Mason as a parent-figure for a female protagonist named Rose da Silva (played by <a href=\"http://www.screened.com/radha-mitchell/14-345039/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Radha Mitchell</a>). <a href=\"http://www.screened.com/christophe-gans/14-181258/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Christophe Gans</a>, the movie director, stated that he felt that the Mother and Daughter relationship was more compelling than the father/daughter connection of the original game. English actor <a href=\"http://www.screened.com/sean-bean/14-291/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Sean Bean</a> also stars in the movie.</p><p>The film received some praise for its visuals, but generally got mildly positive to bad reviews. In spite of this, it grossed quite well at the US box office, and is arguably considered one of the better examples of a video game film adaptation.</p><h3>Silent Hill: Revelation 3D</h3><p>A new <i>Silent Hill</i> movie is scheduled for release at some point during 2012, and it will once again feature both Radha Mitchell and Sean Bean. The game will however follow <a href=\"/heather-mason/3005-2723/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2723\">Heather Mason</a>, who will be portrayed by <a href=\"http://www.screened.com/adelaide-clemens/14-282020/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Adelaide Clemens</a> and will mostly follow the events seen on Silent Hill 3.</p><h2>Soundtracks</h2><p>Apart from Silent Hill: Downpour (the upcoming installment in the series), for which the music will be composed by Dan Licht, all the music for all the previous titles in the Silent Hill franchise was composed by <a href=\"/akira-yamaoka/3040-40927/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-40927\">Akira Yamaoka</a>, in conjunction with a couple of guest composers and musicians for certain songs. However, while the soundtrack for the first two games was mainly composed of a series of short ambiance tracks and compositions, the remaining titles in the series were given a more thought-out approach, and they bear resemblances to actual movie soundtracks, bringing a more cinematic feel to the narrative of the game. Considering that the film adaptation had no original tracks made for it whatsoever, all of the music in the film was taken directly from the games, this could be seen as a successful attempt.</p><p>The music tracks in the first two Silent Hill games were mostly instrumental, but for Silent Hill 3 Akira wanted to incorporate vocals to the soundtrack. He wanted a female vocalist that had a sound comparable to that of Garbage and PJ Harvey. He flew to Los Angeles and auditioned about fifty candidates, until he heard the voice of <a href=\"/mary-elizabeth-mcglynn/3040-22864/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-22864\">Mary Elizabeth McGlynn</a>. Mary Elizabeth has since worked with Akira on several other Silent Hill soundtracks, along with lyricist Joe Romersa.</p><p>The <a href=\"/original-soundtrack/3015-189/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-189\">soundtrack</a> compositions are varied and range from post-industrial to alternative rock, from pop to trip-hop.</p><h3>SILENT HILL</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1513758-sh1_ost.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1513758\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 200px\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"200\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1513758-sh1_ost.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1513758\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/6/62890/1513758-sh1_ost.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/6/62890/1513758-sh1_ost.jpg 200w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/6/62890/1513758-sh1_ost.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/6/62890/1513758-sh1_ost.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\"></noscript></a></figure><table><tbody><tr><th>Track No.</th><th>Title</th><th>Running Time</th></tr><tr><td>01</td><td><b>Silent Hill</b></td><td>02.51</td></tr><tr><td>02</td><td><b>All</b></td><td>01.32</td></tr><tr><td>03</td><td><b>The Wait</b></td><td>00.09</td></tr><tr><td>04</td><td><b>Until Death</b></td><td>00.51</td></tr><tr><td>05</td><td><b>Over</b></td><td>02.04</td></tr><tr><td>06</td><td><b>Devil's Lyric</b></td><td>01.26</td></tr><tr><td>07</td><td><b>Ris ing Sun</b></td><td>00.56</td></tr><tr><td>08</td><td><b>For All</b></td><td>02.39</td></tr><tr><td>09</td><td><b>Follow the Leader</b></td><td>00.52</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td><b>Claw Finger</b></td><td>01.32</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td><b>Hear Nothing</b></td><td>01.33</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td><b>Children Kill</b></td><td>00.19</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td><b>Killed By Death</b></td><td>01.25</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td><b>Don't Cry</b></td><td>01.29</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td><b>The Bitter Season</b></td><td>01.26</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td><b>Moonchild</b></td><td>02.48</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td><b>Never Again</b></td><td>01.01</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td><b>Fear of the Dark</b></td><td>01.13</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td><b>Halfday</b></td><td>00.38</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td><b>Heaven Give Me Say</b></td><td>01.47</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td><b>Far</b></td><td>01.14</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td><b>I'll Kill You</b></td><td>02.52</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td><b>My Justice for You</b></td><td>01.21</td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td><b>Devil's Lyric 2</b></td><td>00.25</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td><b>Dead End</b></td><td>00.17</td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td><b>Ain't Gonn a Rain</b></td><td>01.12</td></tr><tr><td>27</td><td><b>Nothing Else</b></td><td>00.51</td></tr><tr><td>28</td><td><b>Alive</b></td><td>00.33</td></tr><tr><td>29</td><td><b>Never Again</b></td><td>00.45</td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td><b>Die</b></td><td>00.56</td></tr><tr><td>31</td><td><b>Never End.

The game (called <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/shinobi/3030-3482/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3482\"> Shinobi</a>) became a huge arcade success causing Sega to release ports for the Sega Master System, the Nintendo Entertainment System, and various home PC gaming formats. When the 16-bit console the Sega Genesis (also known as the Mega Drive in other regions) arrived, a sequel to Shinobi was one of the first games released for the console. The game was called <a href=\"/the-revenge-of-shinobi/3030-236/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-236\"> Revenge of Shinobi</a>. Released in 1989, Revenge of Shinobi was considered a perfect showcase for the power of the Sega Genesis.

Unlike Revenge of Shinobi, Shadow Dancer was a game released in the arcades. It would later get ported to the Sega Genesis. Sega continued to make Shinobi games for the Master System.

Called <a href=\"/shinobi-iii-return-of-the-ninja-master/3030-16074/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16074\"> Shinobi III: Return of the Ninja Master</a>, Sega once again pushed the envelope in graphics and sound. The game featured many graphic effects that many people thought the Sega Genesis wasn't capable of producing. The gameplay was considered a lot more fluid as well. Because of these positives, Shinobi III is considered the best in the series of Genesis games.</p><p>Now an establish franchise, Sega made a sequel to Shinobi III for their new 32-bit console the Sega Saturn.

At this time, Sega was no longer making consoles as their last two big efforts (Saturn and Dreamcast) met with failure. The developers were now focused on making games for other consoles. Shinobi for the PS2 was a complete overhaul of the series. It featured a new main character, a new story, and a new gameplay system. The game was a commercial success for Sega. However, some gamers and critics complained about the game's very high difficultly. In 2004, Sega released the sequel to the PS2's version of Shinobi. The game was called <a href=\"/nightshade/3030-22069/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-22069\"> Nightshade </a>and is the first game in the series to star a female Shinobi. The game achieved some success, but many gamers and critics consider the game inferior to the first Shinobi for the PS2.</p><h3> </h3><h3>Series Storyline</h3><p>From the first game in the series to Shinobi III, the storyline focused on the heroic efforts of modern day Ninja, <a href=\"/joe-musashi/3005-362/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-362\"> Joe Musashi</a> of the Oboro Clan. Joe's clan was attacked and destroyed by the criminal organization called Neo Zeed. Musashi's mastered was killed and his girlfriend taken hostage. This sets up the adventures in the original Shinobi. Revenge of Shinobi's story takes place when Joe Musashi sets out to destroy the entire Neo Zeed empire. By the end of the game, it's believed Joe accomplished this task. However, Neo Zeed wasn't destroyed and they slowly began rebuilding their empire. Joe finds out and once again becomes the Shinobi to destroy the criminal empire for good. This sets up the events in Shinobi III: Return of the Ninja Master. Joe Musashi has side adventures fighting crime while going after Neo Zeed. Shadow Dancer is suppose to chronicle his side adventures along with his canine sidekick. In the Japanese version of the game, however, the Shinobi in Shadow Dancer is Musashi's son, not Joe himself.</p><p>In Shinobi Legions, Joe Musashi is replaced by a Shinobi named Sho. Sho isn't from the Oboro clan. His story isn't about stopping Neo Zeed either. The story in this game focuses on Sho and his older brother being trained by a Ninja Master. The older brother becomes corrupt with the knowledge of the ancient arts and sets out to create his own criminal empire. He also kidnaps the Master's daughter; forcing her to marry him. Sho sets out to stop his evil brother. The games story is told through live action cut-scenes between game levels.</p><p>The remake of Shinobi for the Playstation 2 once again features a new protagonist. This time the Shinobi is named <a href=\"/hotsuma/3005-5045/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5045\"> Hotsuma </a>and he's a decent of the Oburo Clan. Like Shinobi Legions the game begins with him fighting his brother for the right to lead the Ninja Clan. However, Hotsuma's main adventure puts him against an evil sorcerer named Hiruko who tries to take over a futuristic Japan. The sequel to the Playstation remake called Nightshade, stars a female Shinobi named <a href=\"/hibana/3005-5075/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5075\"> Hibana</a>. She's an agent in a secret government outfit sent to destroy the Nakatomi Organization. She's also set up to be the rival of Hotsuma.</p><h3>Gameplay</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8153/1029826-shinobi.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1029826\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.7\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8153/1029826-shinobi.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1029826\"><img alt=\"First level of the original Shinobi.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/8153/1029826-shinobi.gif\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/8153/1029826-shinobi.gif 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"First level of the original Shinobi.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/8153/1029826-shinobi.gif\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/8153/1029826-shinobi.gif 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>First level of the original Shinobi.</figcaption></figure><p>In the early games, Shinobi featured 2D linear gameplay. The players job was to move left to right through the stages and enemies. The levels are separated into parts. After finishing each part, the player faced the level boss at the end. Shinobi also was the first of many games to pioneer the two layered level design. Instead of just going straight through the level, Shinobi allowed you to jump into the background and you could advance through the level that way. While going through the levels in the original Shinobi, the player had to save hostages. The Shinobi starts out with throwing stars and close martial art attacks. However, you could gain power ups that allowed the Shinobi to use a handgun and his katana. In all the 2D sequels to the original game, the gun was replaced by a more powerful version of throwing stars. The Shinobi could also use various types of Ninja magic. This ranged from calling forth lighting, to completely self-destructing. The self-destruct power up was the most damaging to enemies, but you wasted a life if used. In the 2002 remake of Shinobi, the gameplay was completely changed. The game was remade in 3D, and you controlled the Shinobi from a <a href=\"/third-person-perspective/3015-464/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-464\"> third-person perspective</a> . The goal is to kill all the enemies in a certain section during the level to advance. At the end of each stage is a boss battle. One of the new gameplay features was the link kill. This allowed you to chain enemy kills in a certain amount of time. If done right, the game showed a quick ingame cut-scene of all the linked enemies dying. The Shinobi also used throwing stars, but unlike the 2D games, the stars are used more for strategy. The katana is the main weapon the Shinobi uses to make kills.</p>", "guid": "3025-362", "name": "Shinobi"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-363", "name": "Interstate '76"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-364", "name": "Jade Cocoon"}, {"description": "<p>Jagged Alliance is a franchise known for its methodical pace and rather steep difficulty curve.

The first official James Bond film distributed by MGM, Dr. No, released almost a decade later in 1962 and spawned a long-running film series spanning 26 official films to date.</p><p>The James Bond franchise is one of the most identifiable brand names in the world, and is currently the 5th highest-grossing film franchise. This success has led to several licensed games based on the character - most James Bond games are adaptations of the films, whereas others provide original stories.</p><h2>History</h2><h3><strong>Beginnings (1983 - 1997)</strong></h3><p>The first official game released in the James Bond video game series was back in 1983, a side-scroller simply named \"James Bond 007.\" Since 1983, a number of James Bond titles have appeared on multiple consoles, many critically and financially successful. The franchise had what many consider it's greatest success in 1997, with the release of <a href=\"/goldeneye-007/3030-3166/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3166\">GoldenEye 007</a>, a first-person shooter for the <a href=\"/nintendo-64/3045-43/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-43\">Nintendo 64</a>. Developed by <a href=\"/rare-ltd/3010-174/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-174\">Rare</a> and published by <a href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-90\">Nintendo</a>, it was based on the movie of the same name. The game loosely followed the film's plot, and it is best remembered for its breakthrough four-player multiplayer modes.</p><h3><strong>EA Games (1999 - 2005)</strong></h3><p>After <a href=\"/ea-games/3010-6256/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6256\">EA Games</a> took over the franchise in 1999, future games in the series would be held to the high standard of GoldenEye 007. Even with a few critical successes, such as <a href=\"/007-nightfire/3030-6647/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6647\">'007: Nightfire'</a> and <a href=\"/007-everything-or-nothing/3030-6530/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6530\">'007: Everything or Nothing'</a>, the latter using voices and likenesses from the film franchise, none of them had the lasting effect on gamers the way GoldenEye 007 did. In November 2004, EA released <a href=\"/goldeneye-rogue-agent/3030-14123/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14123\">GoldenEye: Rogue Agent</a>, which attempted to bring GoldenEye 007's success to the <a href=\"/playstation-2/3045-19/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-19\">PlayStation 2</a>, <a href=\"/xbox/3045-32/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-32\">Xbox</a>, and <a href=\"/gamecube/3045-23/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-23\">GameCube</a>. Using the GoldenEye title to fuel gamer's interest, the actual story is in no way tied to that of the original movie or game, but it employed a customizable multiplayer mode incorporating online play. The game failed critically and in the marketplace. Due to poor sales, the planned Rogue Agent franchise was <a href=\"/cancelled-game/3015-2310/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2310\">canned</a>. The last James Bond release from EA was 2005's <a href=\"/007-from-russia-with-love/3030-3641/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3641\">'From Russia With Love'</a>, which included the voice and likeness of <a href=\"/sean-connery/3040-90220/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-90220\">Sean Connery</a>.</p><h3><strong>Activision (2006 - 2014)</strong></h3><p>Activision was the next publisher to acquire the 007 franchise. The first game in franchise that they released, <a href=\"/quantum-of-solace/3030-20726/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20726\">007: Quantum of Solace</a>, was developed by <a href=\"/treyarch/3010-1488/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1488\">Treyarch</a> and utilized the the <a href=\"/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare/3030-2133/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2133\">Call of Duty 4</a> engine. 007: Quantum of Solace included the likeness and voice of <a href=\"/daniel-craig/3040-90200/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-90200\">Daniel Craig</a>, the third Bond actor to provide both for a 007 game, after <a href=\"/pierce-brosnan/3040-89827/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-89827\">Pierce Brosnan</a> and Sean Connery. <a href=\"/activision/3010-78/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-78\">Activision</a> released 007: Quantum of Solace in 2008 for multiple platforms to coincide with the release of the film.</p><p>This was followed by <a href=\"/goldeneye-007/3030-31729/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-31729\">GoldenEye 007</a>, a remake of the Rareware game starring Daniel Craig and rewritten to take place in modern times.

Jet Grind Radio was the first video game to feature this cartoon-like graphical style. Jet Grind Radio was released o the Sega Dreamcast in Japan on June 29, 2000, and was released on November 1 in the United States. The game did not sell well in the United States, but was critically acclaimed and gained a cult following. The sequel, Jet Set Radio Future, was released on February 25, 2002 for the Xbox. The game once again met with poor sales but critical acclaim. In 2003, a port of the original Jet Grind Radio was released on the Game Boy Advance. At Comic-Con 2008, rumors surfaced of a new Jet Grind Radio for the Wii. However, the rumors were silenced when comic book artist Cory \"Rey\" Lewis announced that Jet Grind Radio was proposed to Sega by Kuju Entertainment, though Sega turned them down. Lewis had created concept art for the proposed title.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The basic concept of Jet Grind Radio is simple. Each level has a time limit, a life meter and spots which you need to tag. The player must spray graffiti on designated locations. However, while the player tries to do this, the player will be met with resistance from law enforcement, at first just police officers with nightsticks but eventually helicopters with heat seeking missiles. There is also rival gangs to worry about as well.</p><h3>Jet Set Radio</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5709/699152-143957_full.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-699152\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.69375\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:69.4%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5709/699152-143957_full.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-699152\"><img alt=\"Jet Set Radio.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/5709/699152-143957_full.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/5709/699152-143957_full.jpg 640w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/5709/699152-143957_full.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/5709/699152-143957_full.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Jet Set Radio.</figcaption></figure><p>In this game, the player is given a set amount of time in which they must tag a number of designated spotsl. A trick system is featured - if the player jumps with enough speed, or lands on a grindable rail, a trick is automatically activated. The player may also to skate backwards by flicking the analog stick up and down. The tagging system is based around quick time events triggered when the player activates a tag location. When they do so, a quick time event occurs - the quick time consist of rotating the analog stick in certain directions that the game tells the player.</p><h3>Jet Set Radio Future</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4356/421703-pic_jsrf_008.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-421703\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4356/421703-pic_jsrf_008.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-421703\"><img alt=\"Jet Set Radio Future.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4356/421703-pic_jsrf_008.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/4356/421703-pic_jsrf_008.jpg 640w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4356/421703-pic_jsrf_008.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4356/421703-pic_jsrf_008.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Jet Set Radio Future.</figcaption></figure><p>The second game features a number of improvements from its predecessor. The game features an improved trick system. Tricks are activated by pressing the X button while grinding at a certain pace, and the way skating backwards is done is by pressing the Y button instead of flicking the analog stick up and down. The quick time tagging is removed - the player only has to activate a location to spray their tag. The timer from the original game is also removed. The player gains the ability to boost through the usage of 10 paint cans.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>The story of the Jet Set Radio series is about of group of <i>\"Rudies,\"</i> who are also graffiti artists. They skate around the city of Tokyo-to, tagging their art work as a means of expressing themselves. The story centers around a gang that is known as the GGs. The leader of the gang in the original story is Beat, and in the second game is Corn (Known as Tab in the original). At first they go around and tag their art work while battling rival gangs like the Love Shockers, Poison Jam, and Noise Tank while trying not to get hunted down by the police. The ploat thickens when they find a mysterious record that can summon an ancient demon. A corporation known as the Rokkaku group are hunting for the record, and are kidnapping members of rival street gangs in an effort to discover this record.</p><p>The Story of the second game is basically a retelling of the story of Jet Set Radio. It's partly due to the fact that the developers of the game have stated that it's a re imagining and not a true sequel). Certain points of the story is told a bit differently - the game takes place in the future, more rival gangs are introduced in the story, and the Japanese police is led by different characters.</p><h2>Jet Set Radio Re-Releases and Future Sequels</h2><p>On July 24th, 2008, Sega filed a trademark for their Jet Grind Radio series, separate from the Dreamcast trademark. This, coupled with rumblings from \"industry-insiders\" in Comic-Con, opened speculation for a Wii sequel to the game. A post by Corey Lewis indicated that there was a pitch made to Sega from developer Kuju - now known as Headstrong Games - that was turned down by Sega.</p><p>Jet Set Radio was re-released for a number of digital platforms in 2012. Including consoles, handhelds and mobile devices. The hint for it's re-release first surfaced in a Kotaku article posted on April 25, 2010. The article showed a photo of a game called <i>\"Jet Set Radio\"</i> sitting in someone's game library on an <a data-ref-id=\"3045-20\" href=\"/xbox-360/3045-20/\" slug=\"xbox-360\">Xbox 360</a> dashboard.</p>", "guid": "3025-376", "name": "Jet Set Radio"}, {"description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure chronicles the adventures of the Joestar family spreading across several generations.</p>", "guid": "3025-377", "name": "JoJo's Bizarre Adventure"}, {"description": "<p>Juiced is a franchise of racing games, that was originally launched on the Playstation 2, PC, and Xbox. There have been three games in the Juiced franchise, and all three have revolved around racing on city streets.

The game was intended to have been released in 2004, however, Acclaim went into financial difficulties during this year, and filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The company desperately tried to auction off anything with value to remain afloat, and one of the items they auctioned was the publishing rights to Juiced. The game had originally been intended to release in late 2004, and because of this major setback, its history seemed uncertain.\u00a0 <br/>\u00a0<br/>Eventually, THQ chose to purchase the publication rights for the game, and told the developers to improve the game at the same time. Because of the transfer of the game's rights, and because of the developers having to slightly redesign the game, the release date for the original title slipped further and further back into 2005.\u00a0 <br/>\u00a0<br/>After the release of the game, the second game in the series, Juiced Eliminator was worked on. Eliminator was intended to be a PSP exclusive Juiced game, and it remained so. Eliminator was the more spiritually similar game to the original, while the third game, and currently the final one made (Juiced 2: Hot Import Nights), was more intended to be a sequel. <br/>\u00a0<br/><h2>General Information<br/></h2>Juiced games have appeared on several different platforms, and generally are not the highest rated game series.

Since those heady days Sega has continued to develop and release a number of Sonic games to varying degrees of success. As console power increased so did the scope of the Sonic games, taking in 3D action platforming and racing games. Whilst a number of these titles have been successful in some respects, there is still a yearning nostalgia within the gaming community for Sonic's early ''glory years'', the 2D platform games of old.</p><h2>Early games (1991-1994)</h2><figure style=\"width: 400px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11203/260600-crate_sonic.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-260600\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.7\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11203/260600-crate_sonic.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-260600\"><img alt=\"Sonic The Hedgehog 2\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/11203/260600-crate_sonic.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/11203/260600-crate_sonic.jpg 400w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/11203/260600-crate_sonic.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Sonic The Hedgehog 2</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><a href=\"/sonic-the-hedgehog/3005-73/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-73\">Sonic</a> was first introduced in 1991 with the release of <a href=\"/sonic-the-hedgehog/3030-2465/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2465\">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> for the Sega <a href=\"/genesis/3045-6/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-6\">Genesis</a> (Mega Drive in Europe) and a separate game for <a href=\"/sega-master-system/3045-8/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-8\">Sega Master System</a> also named Sonic The Hedgehog.

Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was also compatible with this lock on technology and also introduced Knuckles as a playable character in Sonic 2.

In November 2005 Sega released <a href=\"/sonic-rush/3030-9479/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9479\">Sonic Rush</a> for the <a href=\"/nintendo-ds/3045-52/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-52\">Nintendo DS</a>.

Although Sonic Rush adds it own gimmicks to the series, this time in the form of a trick system (a series first), and an inane storyline, and more new characters, <a href=\"/blaze-the-cat/3005-2200/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2200\">Blaze the Cat</a> and <a href=\"/eggman-nega/3005-21157/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-21157\">Dr Eggman Nega</a> -- the game was mostly noted for its sheer pace and level design. A sequel, <a href=\"/sonic-rush-adventure/3030-12778/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12778\">Sonic Rush Adventure</a>, was released for the DS in 2007. Although it name includes the word 'Adventure' - taken as a red flag by many Sonic fans - Sonic Rush Adventure nonetheless followed in the footsteps of Sonic Rush for the most part, although it did receive criticism for the many bottomless pits throughout the levels.</p><figure style=\"width: 1057px\" data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/976/1519579-972790_20100913_screen005.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1519579\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.61305581835383\" data-width=\"1057\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:61.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/976/1519579-972790_20100913_screen005.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1519579\"><img alt=\"Sonic The Hedgehog 4: Episode I\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/976/1519579-972790_20100913_screen005.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/976/1519579-972790_20100913_screen005.jpg 1057w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/0/976/1519579-972790_20100913_screen005.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/976/1519579-972790_20100913_screen005.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/976/1519579-972790_20100913_screen005.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Sonic The Hedgehog 4: Episode I\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/976/1519579-972790_20100913_screen005.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/976/1519579-972790_20100913_screen005.jpg 1057w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/0/976/1519579-972790_20100913_screen005.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/976/1519579-972790_20100913_screen005.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/976/1519579-972790_20100913_screen005.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Sonic The Hedgehog 4: Episode I</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Sonic Rush was shortly followed by <a href=\"/sonic-rivals/3030-836/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-836\">Sonic Rivals</a> for Sony PSP, granting Sonic fans even more side scrolling Sonic titles to choose from.

This is due to programming-related issues pertaining to the graphical capabilities of each platform; without properly accounting for how fast the graphical data may need to load in each level, the games may encounter frame rate drops as they struggle to load the necessary information. While this was a hurdle on the Sega Genesis and its sprite usage alone, tackling the matter has become an increasingly important matter for Sonic the Hedgehog games with each successive generation due to the complexity of the respective systems' graphics. The mainstream usage of polygons and textures in videos has therefore made the matter more difficult. Some canonical games in the franchise, such as the Sonic Adventure subseries, attempt to sidestep the issue by placing more emphasis on exploration rather than exclusively speed, as a slower pace enables the console to keep up with the incoming flow of data more easily, or otherwise be able to make more efficient use of smaller environments.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">For the Sonic games whose focus is primarily speed, however, the technology fueling it must be designed appropriately so the game can handle the protagonist's high-speed running without a hitch. In <a href=\"/sonic-unleashed/3030-20953/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20953\">Sonic Unleashed for PS3/360</a> , the game's \"Hedgehog Engine\" on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 is designed to prevent the issue from becoming a problem for players by incorporating data streaming technology. However despite this, the gamer suffers from worse framerate issues than any other 3D Sonic title before it, largely defeating the this supposed purpose in utilizing the Hedgehog Engine in the first place.</p>", "guid": "3025-383", "name": "Sonic the Hedgehog"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-384", "name": "SEGA AGES 2500"}, {"description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Sakura Taisen, localized as \"Sakura Wars\", is a hybrid game series that combines both strategy RPG gameplay with dating sim style adventure segments.

With nine members, it is the largest and oldest group, and starred in the original <a href=\"/sakura-taisen/3030-3379/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3379\">Sakura Taisen</a> game (and its <a href=\"/sakura-taisen-atsuki-chishio-ni/3030-15100/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15100\">PS2 remake</a>), its sequel <a href=\"/sakura-taisen-2-kimi-shinitamou-koto-nakare/3030-2041/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2041\">Sakura Taisen 2</a>, and <a href=\"/sakura-taisen-4-koi-seyo-otome/3030-7770/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7770\">Sakura Taisen 4</a>. The Imperial Assault Troupe also made a cameo appearance in <a href=\"/sakura-taisen-3-pari-wa-moete-iru-ka/3030-8646/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8646\">Sakura Taisen 3</a>.</p><h4><strong>The Paris Assault Troupe</strong></h4><p data-right-indent=\"0\" style=\"margin-left: 30px;\">Based in the Les Chattes Noires <a href=\"/nightclub/3035-793/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-793\">cabaret</a> in Paris, the core pilots' unit is called the \" Groupe Fleur de Paris\" (Flowers of Paris), and pilots the Koubu-F series of Spirit Armor. They starred in Sakura Taisen 3 and Sakura Taisen 4. Their commander was Ichirou Ohgami, who was in Paris on temporary assignment. The cast (minus Ohgami) starred in the adventure-game spinoff Mysterious Paris.</p><h4><b>The New York Combat Revue</b></h4><p data-right-indent=\"0\" style=\"margin-left: 30px;\">The New York Combat Revue is based in the Little Lip Theater, located in Times Square, New York City. Its pilot group is called the Star Division ( \"Hoshigumi\"). Several of its members were reassigned from a previous, experimental Spirit Armor unit (also called the Star Division) that took part in <a href=\"/world-war-i/3015-2189/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2189\">World War I</a>. Its commander is Shinjirou Taiga, nephew of Ichirou Ohgami. They pilot the Star-type Spirit Armor, which can also transform into fighter-jet mecha. They star in <a href=\"/sakura-wars-so-long-my-love/3030-20112/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20112\">Sakura Taisen 5</a>, the installment to be released in North America by <a href=\"/nippon-ichi-software-inc/3010-617/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-617\">Nippon Ichi</a>.</p><h2>Gameplay Systems</h2><p>Core Sakura Taisen releases have combined Adventure-style gaming and <a href=\"/romance/3015-253/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-253\">romance game-like</a> character interaction with turn-based tactical combat.</p><h3>LIPS</h3><p>The bulk of gameplay in a typical Sakura Taisen game is facilitated via \"<a href=\"/timed-decisions/3015-7775/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7775\">LIPS</a>,\" which stands for \"<a href=\"/timed-decisions/3015-7775/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7775\">Live Interactive Picture System</a>.\" LIPS, in essence, is a specialized style of <a href=\"/dialogue-trees/3015-77/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-77\">dialog tree</a>, one that inserts mini-game like elements into the typical \"choose an option\" interaction. At its most basic form, it is a <a href=\"/timed-decisions/3015-7775/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7775\">timed dialog</a> response. Players must choose an option before time runs out. However, letting time run out is also considered a \"valid\" option, one considered as \"no response.\" Different responses appeal to different characters, adding or subtracting \"trust points,\" which eventually determine the ending of the game. Other types of LIPS options exist, some of which were introduced in later installments. One, such as \"Analog LIPS,\" uses the <a href=\"/dual-joystick-shooter/3015-1627/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1627\">analog stick</a> to determine the \"force\" of a response, like to the volume of a shout, etc. Other types of LIPS interactions resemble <a href=\"/quick-time-event/3015-6/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6\">Quick Time Events</a> and other types of <a href=\"/minigames/3015-116/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-116\">mini-games</a>.</p><h3>ARMS</h3><p>Sakura Taisen 1 and 2 featured a <a href=\"/tactical-turn-based-combat/3015-234/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-234\">turn-based</a>, <a href=\"/isometric-viewpoint/3015-246/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-246\">isometric</a>, <a href=\"/grid-based-movement/3015-1318/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1318\">grid-movement</a> combat system similar to <a href=\"/final-fantasy-tactics-the-war-of-the-lions/3030-27994/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-27994\">Final Fantasy Tactics</a>. Later installments use \"ARMS,\" which stands for \"Active Real-time Machine System.\" ARMS is also turn-based, but is instead founded around <a href=\"/action-points/3015-637/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-637\">action points</a> to determine movement range and attacks. Both systems integrate the relationships with different characters to add attribute bonuses during combat, or unlock special combination attacks.</p><h2>Reception</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/9/97089/3143555-sales2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3143555\" data-ratio=\"0.78277153558052\" data-width=\"267\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 267px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:78.3%\" href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/9/97089/3143555-sales2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3143555\"><img alt=\"Fans gathering in Akihabara to purchase Sakura Taisen on launch day in 1996\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/9/97089/3143555-sales2.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/9/97089/3143555-sales2.png 267w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 267px) 100vw, 267px\" data-width=\"267\"></a><figcaption>Fans gathering in Akihabara to purchase Sakura Taisen on launch day in 1996</figcaption></figure><p>The Sakura Taisen franchise is iconic and highly regarded in Japan.

created by <a href=\"/deep-silver-volition-inc/3010-1007/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1007\">Volition</a> Incorporated and originally published by <a href=\"/thq/3010-15/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-15\">THQ</a>, is a series of open world action games. The original game in the franchise, <a href=\"/saints-row/3030-5618/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5618\">Saints Row</a>, has gone on to be a multimillion seller. The series has also garnered attention due to its deep character customization and expansion of the concepts presented in <a href=\"/rockstar-games/3010-1194/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1194\">Rockstar's</a> <a href=\"/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas/3030-7120/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7120\">Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</a>, such as gang rivalries, car customization, and a respect system. Due to THQ's bankruptcy, Saints Row, along with Volition, were sold to <a href=\"/deep-silver/3010-52/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-52\">Deep Silver</a> in 2013.</p><h2>Evolution</h2><p>The Saints Row series began as a relatively grounded and serious story centered around a new <a href=\"/the-boss/3005-8436/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-8436\">recruit</a> in the <a href=\"/3rd-street-saints/3015-1048/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1048\">3rd Street Saints</a>, a gang in the city of <a href=\"/stilwater/3035-161/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-161\">Stilwater</a> fighting for survival amidst conflicts with three larger, more powerful gangs. However, what began as a take on the suburban gangster lifestyle shifted direction in <a href=\"/saints-row-2/3030-20679/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20679\">Saints Row 2</a>, emphasizing more comedic elements. Saints Row 2 takes place in Stilwater again, but this time focuses on attempting to rebuild the 3rd Street Saints after the events of the first game. In <a href=\"/saints-row-the-third/3030-25725/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-25725\">Saints Row: The Third</a>, any notion that the series took itself seriously was thrown out the window, as the game was designed upon a ludicrous series of set pieces permeated with absurd humor that all but abandoned the more serious tones of the earlier games. Following the events of 2, the Saints have complete control of Stilwater and are massive celebrities, so the action shifts to the new city of <a href=\"/steelport/3035-3602/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-3602\">Steelport</a>. Building on the absurdity of the 3rd game, <a href=\"/saints-row-iv/3030-36884/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-36884\">Saints Row IV</a> goes even further, giving the gang control of the White House, adding super powers that the player may use, and introducing <a href=\"/zinyak/3005-27202/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-27202\">aliens</a>.

This is the least popular of the three series, the one that fit the least with the rewrites, and the one that has not had its mech designs reused for any later series.</p><h2>The New Generation Saga</h2><p>The final part of the original <i>Robotech</i> saga was based on <i>MOSPEADA</i>. It introduced the alien Invid, and the Cyclone transforming motorcycle armors.

These signature design aspects exist in the majority of RR titles produced to date.</p><h3>Drifting</h3><p>The drifting mechanic RR has made famous is a snap-to-rail method, reminiscent of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slot_car\" rel=\"nofollow \">slot car</a> toy sets, usually this is handled by the player moving the directional pad (and later left analog stick) while not accelerating which is markebly different from how most racers work which usually require players press the brake pad.  The slot car form allows  for physics-defying feats such as spinning 360s during tight turns, while the no-brakes methodology of achieving it allows for a heightened sense of speed,  More than any other aspect, the drift mechanics have contributed to the arcade-style racing feel that fans of the series enjoy.</p><h3>Cameos</h3><p><a href=\"/namco-bandai-games-inc/3010-382/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-382\">Namco Bandai</a> injects its other franchises and properties into many RR games by way of decals, brand names, livery styles, and even vehicle designs. <a href=\"/pac-man/3025-463/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-463\">Pac-man</a> is the most commonly seen; others include <a href=\"/soul-calibur/3025-347/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-347\">Soul Calibur</a>, <a href=\"/katamari-damacy/3025-402/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-402\">Katamari Damacy</a>, <a href=\"/rally-x/3030-2238/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2238\">Rally-X</a>, <a href=\"/dig-dug/3025-150/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-150\">Dig Dug</a>, <a href=\"/galaxian/3025-225/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-225\">Galaxian</a>, et al.</p><h3>3D graphical innovations</h3><p>The early Ridge Racer titles, which were originally released on the then powerful <a href=\"/namco-system-22/3015-8682/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-8682\">Namco System 22</a> <a href=\"/arcade/3045-84/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-84\">arcade</a> hardware, were known for introducing several major advances in <a href=\"/polygonal-3d/3015-1430/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1430\">3D polygon</a> graphics. The original <a href=\"/ridge-racer/3030-2158/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2158\">Ridge Racer</a> (1993) was the first video game to feature texture-mapped 3D polygons, which was an important breakthrough for 3D polygon graphics in video games, predating Sega's <a href=\"/daytona-usa/3030-22135/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-22135\">Daytona USA</a>. Ridge Racer was also able to run at a high resolution of 640 x 480, at a full 60 frames per second.</p><p>The arcade-only sequel <a href=\"/rave-racer/3030-23244/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-23244\">Rave Racer</a> (1995) took it further, as the first video game to make use of high resolution 3D textures. This gave the textures a level of detail that was unrivalled by any home systems until the release of the <a href=\"/dreamcast/3045-37/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-37\">Sega Dreamcast</a> in 1998. The demo of a planned (but later cancelled) <a href=\"/pc/3045-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a> port of Rave Racer was also used as a showcase for the PowerVR graphics accelerator card in 1996, demonstrating the potential of 3D graphics cards on the PC platform.</p><h2>Arcade Titles</h2><p>Before being more widely known as a series for consoles closely associated with Playstation, Ridge Racer initially started as an arcade game in 1993, to make use of 3D graphics which were then relatively new.</p><p>There were 3 Ridge Racer games released for arcade, if you count all versions of the original Ridge Racer as one game.</p><ul><li><a href=\"/ridge-racer/3030-2158/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2158\">Ridge Racer</a> (The original!

A lucky coincidence lead to Leon accidentally sleeping in on what was meant to be his first day on the job with the R.P.D., and so he was not present when the rest of the department was slaughtered by ravenous zombies.</p><p>Working together with Claire Redfield, Leon managed to escape Raccoon City. He played a minor role in Code Veronica, being the one to alert Chris that his sister had been captured by Umbrella. He went on to play the starring role in Resident Evil 4, set in 2004, when he had become a government agent. He was sent to rescue <a href=\"/ashley-graham/3005-3163/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3163\">Ashley Graham</a>, the President's daughter, who had been kidnapped by <a href=\"/los-illuminados/3015-1745/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1745\">a sinister cult</a> who planned to use Las Plagas to take over the world.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The gameplay of Resident Evil has varied greatly over the lifetime of the franchise. The original Resident Evil relied on a <a href=\"/fixed-camera/3015-1715/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1715\">fixed camera</a> to add a cinematic perspective to each room or area a player entered. The controls were slower and harder to control than the later instalments and aiming was far less accurate. Resident Evil 4 introduced an <a href=\"/over-the-shoulder/3015-2621/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2621\">over the shoulder</a> aiming system and behind the back camera that streamlined many of its predecessors' control issues. In addition, inventory space has traditionally been limited, with ammunition being a scarce, precious commodity, although the most recent title, Resident Evil 5, has far more ammo lying around than previous titles. The series has traditionally included puzzles that require the collection of certain items and completion of riddles to unlock new areas, though this too has steadily been less prioritized as the series progressed more towards being pure action games.</p><h2>Complete List of Resident Evil Games</h2><h3>Canon Series</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5322/471087-re1_cap58_lg.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-471087\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5322/471087-re1_cap58_lg.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-471087\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/5322/471087-re1_cap58_lg.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/5322/471087-re1_cap58_lg.jpg 600w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/5322/471087-re1_cap58_lg.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/5322/471087-re1_cap58_lg.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/5322/471087-re1_cap58_lg.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/5322/471087-re1_cap58_lg.jpg 600w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/5322/471087-re1_cap58_lg.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/5322/471087-re1_cap58_lg.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>The series begins in 1996 with the release of Resident Evil and since then, it has spawned many sequels and prequels. Though the locations differ in every game, the premise remains the same; players take control of a survivor or a member of a rescue team that is trapped in an area infested with flesh-eating zombies thanks to the Umbrella Corporation, a biological weaponry company disguised as a pharmaceutical corporation.

The first scenario is a on rails shooter version of <a href=\"/resident-evil-zero/3030-10247/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10247\">Resident Evil Zero</a> where the player takes on the role of <a href=\"/rebecca-chambers/3005-1306/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1306\">Rebecca Chambers</a> or <a href=\"/billy-coen/3005-3137/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3137\">Billy Coen</a> (or both).

As a result of this decision, these games received mixed to poor reception from fans and critics alike. Operation Raccoon City suffered the worst reception for its flawed game mechanics and being a poor SOCOM clone.</p><ul><li><a href=\"/resident-evil-gaiden/3030-15710/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15710\">Resident Evil: Gaiden</a> (2001)</li><li><a href=\"/resident-evil-the-mercenaries-3d/3030-32811/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-32811\">Resident Evil: The Mercenaries 3D</a> (2011)</li><li><a href=\"/resident-evil-operation-raccoon-city/3030-34553/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-34553\">Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City</a> (2012)</li></ul><h3>Mobile Series</h3><p>The mobile games feature different genre and settings, and were developed by the Japanese and Canadian branches of Capcom.

Romero. However, the director would eventually become Paul W.S. Anderson. The first film, entitled <i>Resident Evil</i>, was released on March 12, 2002. The film was negatively received by critics and fans of the series alike. The major criticism of the film was that it did not follow the storyline of any of the games, instead using vague themes such as zombies and viruses, as well as a couple of specific references, such as the Umbrella Corporation and Raccoon City. Though there were some elements borrowed from Resident Evil and Resident Evil 2, the movie featured an entirely original character in its lead, Alice. None of the prominent characters from the games were featured in the movie, although a single line at the end hinted at \"the Nemesis program\".</p><p>Regardless of the negative reaction (due to the film grossing three times its budget world wide) a sequel was made. Entitled <i>Resident Evil: Apocalypse</i>, the direction was given over to Alexander Witt, though Paul Anderson stayed on the project as writer and producer. Like its predecessor, <i>Apocalypse</i> featured Alice in the lead role, and was not based on an actual Resident Evil game, though it borrowed heavy elements specifically from Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, such as two characters from the game, Jill Valentine (played by Sienna Guillory) and <a href=\"/carlos-oliveira/3005-3058/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3058\">Carlos Oliveira</a> (played by Oded Fehr), as supporting characters, and the Nemesis as the primary threat. Despite implementing characters from the game into the film, <i>Resident Evil: Apocalypse</i> was received even poorer than its predecessor (but still made three times its budget as well).</p><p>The third film, <i>Resident Evil: Extinction</i>, was released in 2007. This time, Russell Mulcahy directed the film. Despite deviating even <i>more</i> wildly from the storyline of the games (instead of the virus being contained by the destruction of Raccoon City, <i>Extinction</i> depicts a world where the human race has nearly been annihilated by hordes of zombies, and where deserts inexplicably cover much of the land masses), the film added another two characters from the series, Claire Redfield and Albert Wesker. The film was more of the same and was once again poorly received by fans and critics, but still turned a nice profit.</p><p>The fourth film, <a href=\"http://www.screened.com/resident-evil-afterlife/16-193250/\" rel=\"nofollow \"><i>Resident Evil: Afterlife</i></a>, was released on the September 2010. The story continues on from the third film and opens with Alice and one of her clones attacking Umbrella's Tokyo facility in pursuit of Albert Wesker. As the story goes on, Alice is left stranded with other survivors, one of which is Chris Redfield. They receive a radio transmission stating that there is a ship just off the coast that is a safe haven for survivors. However, Alice and Co. soon realise that the ship is another plot by Umbrella to harvest humans, but discover that Wesker is on the ship. The film ends with a shot a Jill Valentine (looking much like she does from Resident Evil 5 when under control of Wesker) leading an Umbrella Taskforce to the ship.</p><p><em>Resident Evil: Retribution</em>, released in 2012, opens with Alice awakening at home with her daughter Becky and her husband. She Quickly realizes that she is in a Umbrella Corp underground facility. Out of nowhere, the security system shuts-down and Alice flees to the control room of the facility. She discovers Ada Wong, who works with Albert Wesker, and she is made aware of a five-man team sent by Wesker to rescue them. However, the Red Queen sends Jill Valentine and Rain to kill them.</p><p>A sixth film, <em>Resident Evil: The Final Chapter</em>, is scheduled for a 2016 release.</p><h2>CGI Movies</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.screened.com/resident-evil-degeneration/16-194687/\" rel=\"nofollow \"><i>Resident Evil: Degeneration</i></a>, a full-length CGI movie, was made by Sony and Capcom in 2008. <i>Degeneration</i> takes place in the continuity of the Resident Evil video games, and is set between Resident Evil 4 and 5. The film stars series veterans Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield, who are reunited for the first time since Resident Evil 2. Leon was voiced by Paul Mercier and Claire by Alyson Court.</p><p>The film was directed by Makoto Kamiya, and written by Shotaro Suga. It was first revealed on the <i>Resident Evil: Extinction</i> DVD. Though, the first trailer was revealed at Comic-Con 2008. A tie-in video game, also titled <a href=\"/resident-evil-degeneration/3030-26409/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-26409\">Resident Evil: Degeneration</a>, was made for mobile phones in Japan, and later brought to iPhones and iPod Touches.</p><p>Another CG movie was released in 2012, titled <em>Resident Evil: Damnation</em>. Like <em>Degeneration</em> before it, this one is primarily centered on another one of Leon S. Kennedy's escapades, this time set in a fictional Eastern-European country. He is voiced by <a href=\"/matthew-mercer/3040-100784/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-100784\">Matthew Mercer</a> as opposed to Paul Mercier; Mercer would also go on to voice Leon in Resident Evil 6.</p>", "guid": "3025-397", "name": "Resident Evil"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-398", "name": "Kao the Kangaroo"}, {"description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>The Red Faction franchise is a series of sci fi action/shooters developed by <a href=\"/deep-silver-volition-inc/3010-1007/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1007\">Volition</a> and published by <a href=\"/thq/3010-15/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-15\">THQ</a>. The series has focused its realm and storyline on a distant future of civilization on Mars. The plots of the games usually revolve around some form of oppressive giants that enslave a specific group and an organization known as the 'Red Faction' rise up to fight.</p><h3>Games</h3><p>The space rebellion started in 2001 with the release of the PS2 and PC original, <a href=\"/red-faction/3030-15466/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15466\">Red Faction</a>. Following spectacular sales, Red Faction went multi-platform and continued the new first person shooter franchise in 2002 with <a href=\"/red-faction-ii/3030-12203/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12203\">Red Faction II</a>. However, the sequel didn't sell nearly as well as the original, despite being critically acclaimed.</p><p>The franchise took a rest, and three years later THQ announced in a conference call that Red Faction 3 was being developed as a PS3 exclusive and was due out in 2007 holiday window. Things changed as it was renamed <a href=\"/red-faction-guerrilla/3030-21125/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21125\">Red Faction Guerrilla</a> and the exclusivity was dropped, with an Xbox 360 version also coming along with PlayStation 3 and PC platforms. The biggest differences in the game were the change of perspective from first to third, and the new open world layout of the game. The game was released in the summer of 2009, and while it was again critically praised, it undersold THQ's expectations at retail.</p><p>The franchise quickly followed up with a fourth game, the 2011 release <a href=\"/red-faction-armageddon/3030-25726/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-25726\">Red Faction Armageddon</a>. While still a third person shooter, it removed the positively received free roam mechanics of Guerrilla, and instead became a more linear third person shooter. The game was not received well by the press or public.</p><h3>GeoMod Engine</h3><p>Red Faction features the \"Geomod Engine,\" which was supposed to be able to allow players to <a href=\"/destructible-environment/3015-243/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-243\">destroy certain types of terrain</a>. For instance, if a blast door closed preventing you from proceeding, you could fire rockets into the surrounding rock walls to blast open a hole large enough to allow you through to the other side. The technology worked for the most part, though some said that its use was limited to levels designed around destroying terrain at certain points--the aforementioned door workaround included--as opposed to allowing truly free-form, dynamic play. For Red Faction Guerrilla, they updated the engine calling it GeoMod 2.0, which doesn't allow destruction of the terrain, rather the destruction of any and all buildings &amp; structures.</p><h3>Discontinuation</h3><p>Unfortunately, both Guerrilla &amp; Armageddon were not as commercially successful as THQ had expected, and in July 2011 they announced that the Red Faction franchise would be shelved indefinitely, stating they \"<em>do not intend to carry forward with that franchise in any meaningful way.</em>\"</p><p>THQ continued to have financial difficulties into 2012, and eventually went bankrupt, with all their developers and intellectual properties being sold to the highest bidder. The Red Faction brand went up for auction and on April 22, 2013 it was announced that <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/nordic-games-publishing-ab/3010-7138/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-7138\">Nordic Games Publishing</a> had purchased the rights to Red Faction along with several other former THQ games and franchises.</p><p> </p><h2>Games</h2><h3>Red Faction</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1614/1318893-red_faction_pc_us.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1318893\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.2121212121212\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:121.2%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1614/1318893-red_faction_pc_us.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1318893\"><img alt=\"Red Faction\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/1614/1318893-red_faction_pc_us.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/1614/1318893-red_faction_pc_us.jpg 330w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 528px) 100vw, 528px\" data-width=\"528\"></a><figcaption>Red Faction</figcaption></figure><p><b>Original Release Date:</b> May 22, 2001</p><p><b>Platforms:</b> PS2, PC</p><p><b>Main Article:</b> <a href=\"/red-faction/3030-15466/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15466\">Red Faction</a></p><p>The first Red Faction takes place on Mars and puts players in control of a man named Parker who is leading a rebellion against the antagonist, <a href=\"/ultor/3015-2473/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2473\">Ultor Corporation</a>.

This game features Darius Mason, who is Alec Mason's grandson, and also part of Red Faction. Darius unwittingly helps cultist/terrorist Adam Hale in what seems to be a campaign to mostly cause mass amounts of destruction. Darius then spends the majority of the game trying to undo the problems he has accidentally had a hand in.

Played from a profile perspective, stages are either vertical or side-scrolling. Both games also feature similar story structures. In the original game, Pit must ascend from the Underworld and collect the Three Sacred Treasures, the <a data-ref-id=\"3055-5614\" href=\"/arrow-of-light/3055-5614/\" slug=\"arrow-of-light\">Arrow of Light</a>, the <a data-ref-id=\"3055-5615\" href=\"/wings-of-pegasus/3055-5615/\" slug=\"wings-of-pegasus\">Wings of Pegasus</a>, and the <a data-ref-id=\"3055-5616\" href=\"/mirror-shield/3055-5616/\" slug=\"mirror-shield\">Mirror Shield</a> in order to confront and defeat the dark goddess Medusa and rescue Palutena.

Tensions run high as what starts as a limited strategic release of nuclear weapons snowballs into a bitter exchange of warheads aimed at civilian population centers. When the dust clears it becomes clear that a new way will have to be found to survive and to secure the raw materials needed for society to continue.</p><h3>2129-2155 \u2013 Early Vektan Era</h3><p>This era marks the early days of the colonies of Alpha-Centauri. The planets are settled, the infrastructure established and slowly things are built up. This period ends at the beginning of the great boom on Vekta.</p><h3>2129</h3><p>The first ships arrive on Vekta. Roughly 12 colonies are founded during the years 2129 to 2140. Vekta, about earth sized, is an agrarian and idyllic world, full of natural splendor and lushly forested - an Eden. Agricultural produce skyrockets on Vekta - the colony quickly becomes able to feed itself.</p><h3>2156-2199 \u2013 Platinum Era</h3><p>This era marks the heights of Vektan/Helghan civilization - before the dark days of the coming war.</p><h3>2156-2190</h3><p>Free to invest and tax in their colonies as they wish a period of runaway economic and industrial growth grips the Helghan Administrations two worlds. The Automated Refineries on Helghan are expanded and developed; the orbital shipyard becomes the largest orbital structure outside the Terran system. The Helghan system is a \"Hub\" system that connects Earth to her Colonies - every ship MUST travel through Helghan to get anywhere. The Helghan Administration begins to charge each ship for the privilege - allegedly a fee for Traffic Control, Customs, Search and Rescue and other such services, it is actually a thinly disguised tariff upon all trade in Space. Helghan based ships are granted a \"Residence Permit\" that frees them from some charges, encouraging some shipping companies to relocate.</p><h3>2199-2204 \u2013 First Extrasolar War</h3><p>This marks the lowest ebb of Vektan/Helghan civilization - the system makes a bold stand for freedom and fails. War comes to Alpha Centauri.</p><h3>2200</h3><p>As the situation worsens, the Helghan Administration attempts to first co-opt and then expel all ISA forces from Vekta and Helghan. The ISA Marines and Navy respond with lethal force and a number of skirmishes erupt on and around the two colony worlds. Despite their overwhelming numeric superiority, Helghan troops are poorly equipped, trained and inexperienced and many ISA forces escape the initial fighting. The experienced ISA troops and ships scatter to conduct hit and run operations from hidden bases.</p><h3>2204-2340 \u2013 Early Helghan Era</h3><p>The loyalist Helghan peoples leave Vekta on a trek to the harsh and unforgiving world of Helghan. Long seen as a chemical and mineral storehouse, now Helghan must be tamed - but it changes the Helghan as much as they change it - if not more. This era covers the early days on Helghan.</p><h3>2215-2220</h3><p>The surface of Helghan is formally settled. The bleak existence on Helghan is a far cry from the paradise of Vekta. Initial casualties due to illness, storm damage and starvation are very high. Within ten years, though, the death rate subsides as the Helghan begin to adapt to their surroundings. Slowly a civilization arises from the refugee camps and token Helghan Industry and Food production starts again.</p><h3>2340-2357 \u2013 Helghast Era</h3><p>The tough conditions finally spawn social and economic change. Forced to adapt to a situation so tough that mere humans could never survive it, a charismatic new leader pronounces the birth of the Helghast people: a people no longer human, with a bold drive and vision to succeed.</p><h3>2356</h3><p>The second orbital platform begins construction. Concerned by the Helghan military build-up in progress, the ISA Governor orders the construction of an additional Orbital Platform to complement the 52 year old network already in place. ISA General Stuart Adams is appointed the Military Commander of the network.</p><h3>2357-2360 \u2013 Second Extrasolar War</h3><p>Swollen with pride and new strength the Helghast embark on a bold plan of conquest to rejoin the two halves of the Alpha Centauri system and rebuild their great empire. Their gamble fails and their armies on Vekta are defeated, leading to their worst nightmare: the invasion of Helghan itself. But does Visari have a trick up his sleeve?</p><h3>Mar-2358</h3><p>With the Helghan forces on Vekta shattered a council is called at Vekta City to decide the best policy for the further pursuit of the War against the Helghast to its conclusion. The Council quickly establishes a working list of priorities:</p><ul><li>Remove the Helghast as a military threat.</li><li>Capture Autarch Visari for a public trial.</li><li>Establish a more easily controlled regime on Helghan that avoids the oppression that sparked this conflict.</li></ul><p>These priorities are in clear violation of the UCA orders given before their Fleets withdrawal - but the ISA Council becomes concerned that the UCN wishes to blame past decisions regarding treatment of the Helghast upon them.</p><h3>Sep-2358</h3><p>Operation Archangel commences. The ISA fleet launches for Helghan to begin the most complex military action in human history.</p><h3>Nov-2359</h3><p>The invasion of Helghan begins. Twelve battle groups arrive at Helghan. One, Battle Group Mandrake, is comprised of one division of ISA and 10 divisions of Legionnaires. ISA Cruiser New Sun is the Flagship of the Battle group, under the command of war hero Colonel Jan Templar. Mandrake is to deploy to Pyrrhus and take the city, hopefully snagging Visari in the process, as it is one of the primary population bases as well as a center of trade for the planet.</p><p>The ISA and Helghast warships engage each other in orbit. The ISA fleet outclasses the Helghast fleet significantly and quickly establishes a total orbital blockade.</p><p>At this point the ISA Council reaffirms its decision to break the UCA orders to simply isolate the Helghast and launch their invasion. Channels are cleared for the troop deployment and the way is made clear for the invasion. Negotiations are not a possibility. Visari vows the entire world of Helghan will repel the invaders. The ISA knows it has to complete the invasion swiftly.</p>", "guid": "3025-405", "name": "Killzone"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-406", "name": "RC Pro-Am"}, {"description": "<h2>Overview</h2>The King of Fighters is a 2D fighting game series created by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-616\" href=\"/snk-playmore/3010-616/\">                                                                             SNK</a>.

The buttons are usually labeled as A, B, C, D and correspond to Light Punch, Light Kick, Heavy Punch, and Heavy Kick respectively. There is also a universal attack known as the \"Blowback\" or \"CD Attack\" that will always knock down the opponent; it is performed by pressing C+D in most games, or the E button in KOFXI. <br />\u00a0<br />   The primary mechanic that separates KOF from other fighting games is its 3-on-3 battles; each player selects three characters to use, and battle continues until one team is completely defeated. There are typically 3-to-5 rounds, and when one player is KO'd, the other regains a small amount of life at the start of the next round. The exceptions to the above rules are <a data-ref-id=\"3030-18240\" href=\"/the-king-of-fighters-2003/3030-18240/\">                                                                          The King of Fighters 2003</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-5030\" href=\"/the-king-of-fighters-xi/3030-5030/\">                                                                        XI</a>, which utilize <a data-ref-id=\"3025-513\" href=\"/marvel-vs-capcom/3025-513/\">                                                                         Marvel vs. Capcom-style</a> tag mechanics.<br />\u00a0<br />In terms of actual fighting, The King of Fighters is comparable to <a data-ref-id=\"3025-331\" href=\"/street-fighter/3025-331/\">                                                                              Street Fighter</a> in general structure, but tends to favor the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-5767\" href=\"/rushdown/3015-5767/\">                                                                                rushdown</a> style of play thanks to its numerous movement options.\u00a0 Perhaps the most important of these options are KOF's four types of jumps. In addition to the normal jump, there is the Super Jump (performed by pressing down, then holding an upward direction) which allows the character to travel across much of the screen, but makes them very vulnerable to attacks. The Short Hop, performed by quickly tapping and releasing an upward direction, causes the character to perform a much smaller jump. Finally, the Hyper Hop, performed by pressing down, then quickly tapping up-left or up-right, makes the character perform a far-traveling, low-height jump. These jumps allow the player to attack from several different angles.<br />\u00a0 <br />Another unique quirk in KOF is how \"command normals\" (normal attacks which require a single directional input and a button press) are handled. For the most part, a command normal that is used standalone cannot be canceled out of; however, they have other special properties such as hitting as an \"overhead\" or forcing a knockdown. In KOF, a command normal can be canceled into from a normal attack, but (usually)\u00a0 surrenders all of its special properties in the process. Comboed command moves can then be special-canceled.<br /><br />The Roll is another key mechanic. Replacing the Dodge from KOF '94/'95, rolling allows the player to get around certain attacks, most notably projectiles, and can be used to confuse the opponent after a knockdown.\u00a0\u00a0 <br />\u00a0<br />In order to balance the numerous attack options in KOF, there are two separate mechanics implemented to help players deal with offensive pressure. Guard Cancel Blowback, performed by pressing CD while blocking an attack, causes the character to immediately perform their CD Attack; likewise, Guard Cancel Roll, performed by pressing AB while blocking an attack, causes the action to freeze for a short moment while the player's character rolls out of the way. Both of these attacks use 1 stock of super meter.  <figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6735/538766-kof98_q.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-538766\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6735/538766-kof98_q.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-538766\"><img alt=\"\u00a0Both types of Desperation Move gauges are available in KOF '98\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/6735/538766-kof98_q.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/6735/538766-kof98_q.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0Both types of Desperation Move gauges are available in KOF '98</figcaption></figure><br />\u00a0<br />KOF also inherits \"Desperation Moves\" from <a data-ref-id=\"3030-2760\" href=\"/art-of-fighting/3030-2760/\">                                                                               Art of Fighting</a>. In KOF '94-'96 (and in the \"Extra\" mode in '97 and '98), Desperation Moves are available when the player has low health; however, players can also manually charge a meter to gain access to a Desperation Move at any time. Having a full meter at low life allows for the usage of Super Desperation Moves.\u00a0 <br />\u00a0<br />From '97 forward, Desperation Moves are strictly tied to a super meter, which in most cases hold a maximum of three \"stocks\" at the start of a fight and increase in capacity based on the number of characters that the player has lost. <br /><h2>Series Summary<br /></h2>This is a summary of each main-series KOF game.

Many fireball attacks were modified to become short-ranged; some characters would eventually get their normal fireball back in later titles, while others remain short-ranged to this day. Several characters are added, including <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2235\" href=\"/kasumi-todoh/3005-2235/\">                                     Kasumi Todoh</a> from the Art of Fighting, original characters <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3460\" href=\"/mature/3005-3460/\">                                    Mature</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3461\" href=\"/vice/3005-3461/\">                                   Vice</a>, and a Boss Team consisting of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-280\" href=\"/geese-howard/3005-280/\">                                  Geese Howard</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-11\" href=\"/wolfgang-krauser/3005-11/\">                                 Wolfgang Krauser</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2040\" href=\"/mr-big/3005-2040/\">                                Mr. Big</a>.

The game includes two fighting styles: Advanced, which is like The King of Fighters '96 but with a traditional fighting game super meter system, and Extra, which features the meter system, Dash, and Dodge from '94 and '95. The game features a new team of original antagonists known as the New Face Team. Additionally, Chizuru becomes a playable character, Billy Kane returns alongside two new characters from Fatal Fury, and Kusanagi fanboy <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3494\" href=\"/shingo-yabuki/3005-3494/\">                             Shingo Yabuki</a> is introduced.

After that, players fight full-powered versions of the New Face Team, and then Orochi is channeled through New Face Team member <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3757\" href=\"/chris/3005-3757/\">                           Chris</a> to become the final boss. <br />\u00a0<br /><h3>Dream Match - KOF '98</h3>With the Orochi Saga finished, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-10621\" href=\"/the-king-of-fighters-98-the-slugfest/3030-10621/\"> <b>The King of Fighters '98</b></a> gives some of the older/\"deceased\" characters one last hurrah before moving on to the next saga. The game refines the mechanics introduced in KOF '97 and brings back a few characters from '95 and '96 that were absent in the previous game. Omega Rugal returns as the final boss of the game. <br />\u00a0<br />This game is one of the most well-received in the series. It received a remake in <a data-ref-id=\"3030-21699\" href=\"/the-king-of-fighters-98-ultimate-match/3030-21699/\">                                                            The King of Fighters '98 Ultimate Match</a> that features every character from '94 - '98 and allows players to mix-and-match mechanics from the Advanced and Extra styles. <br />\u00a0<br /><h3>NESTS Saga - KOF '99 - 2001</h3>   Starting with <a data-ref-id=\"3030-5964\" href=\"/the-king-of-fighters-99/3030-5964/\"> <b>The King of Fighters '99</b></a>, KOF enters the NESTS Saga; this saga drops the Orochi plot in favor of a science-fiction-oriented setting. With this new story comes a new protagonist, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-220\" href=\"/k/3005-220/\">                                                         K'</a>; Kyo and Iori are relegated to secret characters.\u00a0 <br />\u00a0<br /><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4495/504813-kof99arcade.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-504813\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.73684210526316\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:73.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4495/504813-kof99arcade.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-504813\"><img alt=\"\u00a0'99 introduces assist characters known as \"><noscript><img alt=\"\u00a0'99 introduces assist characters known as \"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0'99 introduces assist characters known as \"Strikers\"</figcaption></figure>The game introduces the Striker System, Counter/Armor modes, and the Slide. The player now chooses four characters; the first three are controlled by the player, while the final character serves as an Striker. Strikers (like \"Assists\" in other fighting games) can be called into the fight at anytime to perform an single attack or other action. Counter Mode and Armor Mode are two separate powerups that can be activated when the super meter is full; Counter Mode grants unlimited Super Moves, while Armor Mode grants Super Armor. The Slide replaces the Roll in this game (and only this game), and allows players to attack during the move. <br />\u00a0<br />New characters include <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2230\" href=\"/maxima/3005-2230/\">                          Maxima</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3499\" href=\"/whip/3005-3499/\">                         Whip</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-4376\" href=\"/jhun-hoon/3005-4376/\">                        Jhun Hoon</a>, with <a data-ref-id=\"3005-4381\" href=\"/li-xiangfei/3005-4381/\">                       Li Xiangfei</a> crossing over from Fatal Fury. The plot of the game revolves around and organization that plans to use Kyo clones to take over the world, with NESTS agent <a data-ref-id=\"3005-4327\" href=\"/krizalid/3005-4327/\">                      Krizalid</a> serving as the final boss. <br />\u00a0<br />By the time of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-15728\" href=\"/the-king-of-fighters-2000/3030-15728/\"> <b>The King of Fighters 2000's</b></a> release, SNK knew that they were about to enter bankruptcy. With this title possibly being the last, they filled it to the brim with fanservice related to the company. When choosing a Striker, players are given two options: either use the fourth character as a Striker like in '99, or switch to an alternate character. These alternate characters include <a data-ref-id=\"3005-163\" href=\"/nakoruru/3005-163/\">                     Nakoruru</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-284\" href=\"/fio-germi/3005-284/\">                    Fio Germi</a>, an early concept of Kyo known as \"Syo Kirishima,\" and many others. KOF 2000 is less restrictive about when Strikers can be used that '99, and players can restore one Strike Bomb (at the cost of one stock of super meter) by taunting. The Counter and Armor modes return from KOF '99. The plot revolves around Zero, a rogue NESTS agent; he uses the Zero Cannon to demolish Southtown, the city introduced in Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting. New characters include secret agents <a data-ref-id=\"3005-4379\" href=\"/seth/3005-4379/\">                   Seth</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3496\" href=\"/ramon/3005-3496/\">                  Ramon</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3497\" href=\"/vanessa/3005-3497/\">                 Vanessa</a>; <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3495\" href=\"/kula-diamond/3005-3495/\">                Kula Diamond</a> is also introduced as a secret sub-boss.<br /><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8690/437040-kof22.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-437040\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.8\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:80.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8690/437040-kof22.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-437040\"><img alt=\"\u00a02001 is a very...different-looking entry\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/8690/437040-kof22.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/8690/437040-kof22.jpg 720w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/8690/437040-kof22.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/8690/437040-kof22.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"\u00a02001 is a very...different-looking entry\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/8690/437040-kof22.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/8690/437040-kof22.jpg 720w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/8690/437040-kof22.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/8690/437040-kof22.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a02001 is a very...different-looking entry</figcaption></figure>\u00a0<br />With SNK's collapse, it would seem that KOF was finished.

In this game, players can freely choose how many of their characters are playable and how many characters become Strikers, with the number of Super Meter stocks and the length of the gauge dependent on this decision. The game is the debut of the NESTS Team, which includes Kula, her caretaker <a data-ref-id=\"3005-4357\" href=\"/foxy/3005-4357/\">              Foxy</a>, and new characters <a data-ref-id=\"3005-4356\" href=\"/angel/3005-4356/\">             Angel</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-219\" href=\"/k9999/3005-219/\">            K9999</a>, and also adds other returning characters.

This game, like '98, is not canonical, and therefore can use \"dead\" characters such as Mature, Vice, and the New Face/Orochi Team. It ditches the Striker System, returning to 3-on-3 battles. The games new features are Max Mode, which allows specials to be canceled into each other or Desperation Moves, and Hidden Super Desperation moves, which are very powerful attacks that can only be used at very low health. A NESTS Team member is fought as a midboss, while Rugal once again returns as the final boss.<br />\u00a0<br />Like '98, the game was well-received and was remade into <a data-ref-id=\"3030-25902\" href=\"/the-king-of-fighters-2002-unlimited-match/3030-25902/\">                                                     The King of Fighters 2002 Unlimited Match</a>. This remake features almost every character from the NESTS saga. K9999, a character who is widely considered (even by SNK Playmore) to be a ripoff of a <a data-ref-id=\"3005-4925\" href=\"/tetsuo-shima/3005-4925/\">                                           certain anime character</a>, is replaced by <a data-ref-id=\"3005-13048\" href=\"/nameless/3005-13048/\">         Nameless</a>; Nameless is functionally identical to his predecessor. <br />\u00a0<br /><h3>Ash Saga - KOF 2003, XI - XIII</h3>Playmore, a company created after the original SNK went bankrupt, managed to buy back all of SNK's properties. No longer needing Eolith's services, they released <a data-ref-id=\"3030-18240\" href=\"/the-king-of-fighters-2003/3030-18240/\"> <b>The King of Fighters 2003</b></a>. This game shakes up KOF's traditional formula by introducing real-time tagging to the series.

KOF XI    introduces the Skill Meter, which allows players to Super Cancel and use the new tag mechanics: Quick Shift and Saving Shift. Quick Shift lets players tag out during a combo, while Saving Shift lets players tag out when they are hit by an attack. KOF XI adds new characters, such as <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3503\" href=\"/elisabeth-blanctorche/3005-3503/\">      Elisabeth Blanctorche</a>, but also removes mainstays such as <a data-ref-id=\"3005-182\" href=\"/mai-shiranui/3005-182/\">     Mai Shiranui</a> (though she and a few others would return in the console version). The final bosses are Shion and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-4321\" href=\"/magaki/3005-4321/\">    Magaki</a>, two more members of Those From the Past. <br />\u00a0<br />Years passed between KOF XI's release and the first gameplay footage of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-21519\" href=\"/the-king-of-fighters-xii/3030-21519/\"> <b>The King of Fighters XII</b></a>. All-new, high-definition sprites were drawn for the characters, and the game was made for Taito's Type X2 hardware. KOF XII is not a canon game and has no \"official\" teams. It forgoes the tag format for the traditional 3-to-5 round setup. The game's main mechanic is the Critical Counter; landing a counter hit with the C or D buttons while the game's \"Critical Gauge\" is full lets players freely cancel their attacks for a short time. The game was panned by fans and professional reviewers alike due to the lack of characters (20-22 compared to 30-40 in the previous entries) and stripped down movesets, short arcade mode with no final boss, and the essentially-unplayable online mode.  <figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1134/1849214-2132456595_full.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1849214\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1134/1849214-2132456595_full.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1849214\"><img alt=\"\u00a0Almost all of XII's missteps were addressed in XIII\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/1134/1849214-2132456595_full.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/1134/1849214-2132456595_full.jpg 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/0/1134/1849214-2132456595_full.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/1134/1849214-2132456595_full.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/1134/1849214-2132456595_full.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"\u00a0Almost all of XII's missteps were addressed in XIII\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/1134/1849214-2132456595_full.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/1134/1849214-2132456595_full.jpg 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/0/1134/1849214-2132456595_full.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/1134/1849214-2132456595_full.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/1134/1849214-2132456595_full.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0Almost all of XII's missteps were addressed in XIII</figcaption></figure><br />\u00a0<br />One year later, in 2010, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-30142\" href=\"/the-king-of-fighters-xiii/3030-30142/\"> <b>The King of Fighters XIII</b></a> was released to arcades.

Baseball series is a collection of baseball games based on, if not always licensed by, Major League Baseball. The series got its start as a localized version of <a href=\"/namco-bandai-games-inc/3010-382/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-382\">Namco</a>'s Famicom-based baseball series, Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium. The game was originally released in Japan in 1986. In 1987, a US conversion appeared in arcades on Nintendo's NES-based Vs. hardware. In 1988, a version of the original Family Stadium was converted to contain players from the US-based Major League Baseball organization and released by Tengen.R.B.I. Baseball 2 and 3 had a similar gameplay style as Namco's games, but the credits screen proudly touts them as \"Designed in Milpitas, CA, U.S.A.\" The most notable change in the sequels is a switch to a more-realistic graphical style for the players. The franchise would continue to stray from Namco's original blueprint, with versions of the game appearing on the Sega Genesis that bore only a passing resemblance to the original. Meanwhile, Namco continued the Famista series on the Famicom well into the 1990s.</p><p>Despite all the updates, the original 1988 release is still considered by most to be the best, and a small pocket of extremely hardcore players continue to play it in leagues to this day. Some players have also taken to modifying dumps of the original NES cart ROMs to include modern players, though the legality of such a maneuver is questionable, at best.</p><p>In 2008, the ESRB posted an entry for a new RBI Baseball game for Xbox Live Arcade, listing the developer as <a href=\"/six-degrees-games/3010-6266/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6266\">Six Degrees Games</a>.
