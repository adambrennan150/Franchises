These games were developed by Day 1 Studios for the Xbox console. Both titles in the franchise are backwards compatible.<br/><br/><h2>Differences</h2>One of the core changes in MechAssault from MechWarrior is the arcade-style play that it inherited by being a console-based franchise. There are also other gameplay tweaks that have been implemented that further remove it from its brethren.<br/><br/><h3>Salvage</h3>In addition to the weapons that come equipped to each 'Mech chassis, additional weapons can be salvaged after destroying other 'Mechs. The drops are divided into the same three categories the weapons are (plus armor): ballistics, energy, and missile. Once you acquire an item salvage, it \"levels up\" the current weapon you have. There is a maximum of three upgrades, starting with 1 being the stock weapon. There are also armor drops that restores the \"health\" or armor level of the 'Mech slightly. Most of the criticism of the series stems from these changes, as they are not as realistic as MechWarrior.<br/><br/><h3>Neurohacking</h3>This practice is also commonly referred to as 'Mech-jacking. In MechAssault 2: Lone Wolf, players can don powered armor and catch rides on friendly 'Mechs as they pass by. However, latching onto an enemy 'Mech results in a follow-the-button-presses dialog displayed on screen. If successful, the 'Mech will eject its pilot and the player in the powered armor can effectively steal the enemy 'Mech. Failure, however, results in being thrown off the back of the machine and usually results in sudden termination (read: death). This is another depature from MechWarrior, as powered armor was never a large part of the battlefield for that series.", "guid": "3025-518", "name": "MechAssault"}, {"description": "<p>The MechWarrior franchise is essentially a digital version of the classic Battletech RPG. In these games the player takes control of a single BattleMech (referred to as 'Mech for short) rather than a group of 'Mechs (called a lance). As the player you will encounter other BattleMechs, tanks, infantry, and more from either within the cockpit of the 'Mech or from one of two third-person cameras.</p><h2>Awards</h2><p>MechWarrior 2 and MechWarrior 3 were both Origins Award winners taking the slots for \"Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Computer Game\" in 1995 and \"Best Action Computer Game\" in 1999 respectively.</p><h2>Timeline</h2><p>The franchise takes place in the distant future where these MechWarrior's and their 'Mechs are used as pawns of politics for several major houses. These houses are always at war with each other and the following is the timeline of the MechWarrior titles (in order of release, not chronological):</p><ul><li>MechWarrior takes place during the last stages of the Third Succession War (late 3020's).</li><li>MechWarrior 2, Ghost Bear's Legacy and Mercenaries take place before, during, and after the Clan Invasion of The Inner Sphere (Up to 3057).</li><li>MechWarrior 3 takes place during different parts of \"Operation Bulldog\", the Inner Sphere counter-attack against The Clans, targeting Clan Smoke Jaguar (3059).</li><li>MechWarrior 4 and its expansions take place within the Federated Commonwealth Civil War (3062 to 3067).</li><li>The newest game in the series, to be entitled MechWarrior Online (not MechWarrior 5), takes place with the timeline meant to advance real time, kicking off 3049.</li></ul><h2>Houses</h2><p>The notable and major houses in the MechWarrior / Battletech universe are (in no particular order):</p><ul><li>House Steiner</li><li>House Liao</li><li>House Marik</li><li>House Kurita</li><li>House Davion</li></ul><h2>Music</h2><p>Composer and producer Duane Decker has done a ton of audio and musical works for the franchise over most of its history. He has done background music tracks for MechWarrior 3 and its expansions, but his more notable works are with MechWarrior 4. He composed the score for MechWarrior 4: Vengeance which was later released on CD, he was also audio lead on the game as well. In addition, he composed the background music for its two expansions.</p><h2>Feature Film</h2><p>Electric Entertainment, a production company founded by Dean Devlin, which currently holds all options to produce a film based upon the MechWarrior universe. However, in 2003 Devlin approached Paramount to pitch the project but failed to received funding. The project is currently in development hell.</p><h2>Role-Playing Game</h2><p>In addition to the many PC games published under the MechWarrior name, there have been 3 editions of a role-playing game under the same name, the first of which was published in 1985.

Created by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-476\" href=\"/bungie-studios/3010-476/\" slug=\"bungie-studios\">Bungie Software</a>, Myth is often referred to as a real-time tactical series due to its focus on squad-level combat over grand strategy. It built a strong following over a relatively short period of time by offering an attractive alternative to the typical base-building and resource-gathering mechanics that dominated real-time strategy games of its day. Its appeal was bolstered by a full <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1430\" href=\"/3d/3015-1430/\" slug=\"3d\">3D</a> graphics engine, something uncommon for strategy games at the time, which employed a detailed physics engine that had a tangible impact on gameplay. Despite the current dormancy of the series, the existing Myth games continue to be played and supported online by the series' dedicated fanbase. With access to tools for creating new content and (eventually) the games' source code as well, the Myth player community has given the series a surprisingly long lifespan that has survived both the shutdown of the original Bungie.net multiplayer servers and <a data-ref-id=\"3010-450\" href=\"/take-two-interactive-software-inc/3010-450/\" slug=\"take-two-interactive-software-inc\">Take-Two Interactive</a>'s cessation of all active support for the franchise.</p><h2>General Gameplay</h2><p>Through all three iterations of the series Myth gameplay has focused on direct control of small numbers of units of varying types. Whether it be single-player or multiplayer, the units a player starts with cannot be revived or replaced if killed, and thus the primary imperative of Myth is to use one's given units as effectively as possible in order to overcome all opposition with as few casualties as possible. This involves utilizing appropriate unit formations and tactics in order to flank or surround enemies, recognizing and using advantageous terrain features, and exploiting unit weaknesses whenever possible. Since players will quite often be gravely outnumbered, it is also important to be able to properly gauge when one is at a disadvantage and adjust tactics accordingly either by retreating or manipulating an opponent into a poor position where their advantage can't be fully utilized. Players are notified by voice-over whenever a unit or group of units dies, as casualties usually have a significant impact on the makeup of an army and how the rest of a scenario plays out.</p><p>The engine used throughout the series comes with fairly detailed simulated physics for most objects in the environment. This effects everything from the path of projectiles used by ranged units to the speed at which a severed head rolls down an incline. Events governed by the physics engine can often lead to unexpected outcomes as well. An inanimate object accidentally propelled with enough force can harm or kill a unit, or a dwarven molotov may bounce at a bad angle into a friendly formation; it is this kind of unpredictability that, when combined with the persistent blood stains and gore left after battles, colors even the most carefully calculated engagements in Myth with a degree of chaotic uncertainty.</p><h2>Single-Player Structure</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/1797637-devil_soverlook.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1797637\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/1797637-devil_soverlook.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1797637\"><img alt=\"Impossible odds are par for the course in Myth.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/1797637-devil_soverlook.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/11/118253/1797637-devil_soverlook.png 1920w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11/118253/1797637-devil_soverlook.png 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/118253/1797637-devil_soverlook.png 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/1797637-devil_soverlook.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Impossible odds are par for the course in Myth.</figcaption></figure><p>Focusing on the armies of the Light, each game in the series features a lengthy single-player campaign composed of roughly two dozen individual scenarios. The objectives from one mission to the next can vary greatly, but accomplishing the mission at hand almost always involves engaging in battle with the armies of the Dark, with a heavy emphasis on overcoming serious disadvantages, either numerical or otherwise, through sound tactical decisions. Though it is often quite difficult to come away from a mission unscathed, players are rewarded for doing so with the possibility of having veteran units that survived the battle return in later missions, which is quite the boon, as veterans are far more effective in battle than an untested unit.</p><p>From its beginning, the main narrative conceit of the Myth franchise has been voiced journal entries, read by an unknown narrator between missions, which set the stage and tone for events to come as well as outlining the demands of the next mission. These are accompanied from time to time by additional exposition by way of cutscenes, and together the two story elements of Myth form a picture of a bleak world in which mankind is beset by hostile forces beyond their ken, where men band together to fight back forces that wish their destruction for unknown reasons.</p><h2>Multiplayer</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/1797645-mythtflunittrading.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1797645\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/1797645-mythtflunittrading.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1797645\"><img alt=\"A glimpse at Myth: TFL's unit trading interface\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/1797645-mythtflunittrading.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/11/118253/1797645-mythtflunittrading.png 640w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/118253/1797645-mythtflunittrading.png 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/1797645-mythtflunittrading.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>A glimpse at Myth: TFL's unit trading interface</figcaption></figure><p>While single-player and multiplayer Myth share the same basic gameplay, the competitive online component of the series features a wide variety of unique competitive modes and maps. Players still control a finite number of units, though most matches begin with a unit trading phase in which players can mix and match different unit combinations by selling and purchasing units with predetermined point values. Unit selection adds further tactical options to multiplayer, as each player must consider not only the objective of the current game mode but also their general strategy and the units they expect to face when building a squad. In addition to a range of competitive options such as the Body Count (essentially Myth's version of <a data-ref-id=\"3015-451\" href=\"/deathmatch/3015-451/\" slug=\"deathmatch\">deathmatch</a>) and <a data-ref-id=\"3015-25\" href=\"/capture-the-flag/3015-25/\" slug=\"capture-the-flag\">Capture the Flag</a> variants, cooperative play using single-player maps is possible as well.</p><p>At the time of their release the first two iterations of Myth were supported by Bungie's own free multiplayer service known as Bungie.net, which featured chat lobbies and numerous \"rooms\" in which to participate in both ranked and casual matches.

This came with some significant caveats, however, as it was criticized by many for prohibitive difficulty, claustrophobic camera angles, and a clunky interface. Bungie seemed to take these comments to heart, as most of the major points of contention players had with the game were addressed through patches, and Myth II would adopt most of these changes as well as going even further to make Myth a more user-friendly and intuitive experience. While TFL certainly enjoyed its success, most fans would make the switch to Myth II the following year, which made significant strides in not only fostering the creation of user-generated content, but also making it more easy to access in-game.</p></td></tr><tr><td><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/44034/1388264-myth_ii_box__large_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1388264\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.1072664359862\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:110.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/44034/1388264-myth_ii_box__large_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1388264\"><img alt=\"Myth II: Soulblighter\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 578px) 100vw, 578px\" data-width=\"578\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/4/44034/1388264-myth_ii_box__large_.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/4/44034/1388264-myth_ii_box__large_.jpg 578w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/4/44034/1388264-myth_ii_box__large_.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Myth II: Soulblighter\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/4/44034/1388264-myth_ii_box__large_.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/4/44034/1388264-myth_ii_box__large_.jpg 578w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/4/44034/1388264-myth_ii_box__large_.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 578px) 100vw, 578px\" data-width=\"578\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Myth II: Soulblighter</figcaption></figure></td><td><h3><a data-ref-id=\"3030-20240\" href=\"/myth-ii-soulblighter/3030-20240/\" slug=\"myth-ii-soulblighter\">Myth II: Soulblighter</a> (1998)</h3><p>The successful follow-up to Myth: TFL, Myth II picks up narratively sixty years after the previous game as Soulbighter emerges to threaten the world once more. Very little was changed by Bungie in gameplay terms, however it received a significant graphical boost over its predecessor with support for Direct3D, higher resolutions, and various new engine enhancements like fog and destructible objects. It was met with a high amount of praise from fans and critics upon its release, though it was ironically also subject to one of the worst bugs in gaming history, which could potentially delete the entire contents of a user's hard drive. Thankfully this bug was caught before the game actually went on sale, and to date only one person (the one who discovered the bug) was known to have been affected by it. Myth II went on to become even more popular than TFL, and is without a doubt the most heavily played and modified game in the franchise.</p></td></tr><tr><td><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1702/1154831-myth3box.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1154831\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.35\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:135.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1702/1154831-myth3box.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1154831\"><img alt=\"Myth III: The Wolf Age\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/1702/1154831-myth3box.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/1702/1154831-myth3box.jpg 420w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/1702/1154831-myth3box.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Myth III: The Wolf Age\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/1702/1154831-myth3box.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/1702/1154831-myth3box.jpg 420w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/1702/1154831-myth3box.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Myth III: The Wolf Age</figcaption></figure></td><td><h3><a data-ref-id=\"3030-2126\" href=\"/myth-iii-the-wolf-age/3030-2126/\" slug=\"myth-iii-the-wolf-age\">Myth III: The Wolf Age</a> (2001)</h3><p>Coming out shortly after the Take-Two acquisition of the franchise, Myth III takes place 1,000 years before the events of the first two games and follows the deeds of Connacht the Wolf, a famous personage in the Myth world mentioned only in passing in previous games. While this iteration of Myth is wildly divergent from previous ones visually, with fully polygonal rather than sprite-based unit models among other things, it is in fact based on the same engine. Though it was generally well received at the time of its release, it was also the subject of a minor controversy due to the fact that the PC and Mac versions were not released simultaneously, which angered many Macintosh Myth fans. The game was released with numerous bugs and stability issues as well, which was compounded by the fact that support for the product was ceased almost immediately after it shipped. With the later source code release, however, fans were able to continue updating the game where the developers left off.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Fan Content &amp; Development</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/1968095-leggomymyth_.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1968095\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/1968095-leggomymyth_.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1968095\"><img alt=\"Leggo My Myth, the plugin that \"><noscript><img alt=\"Leggo My Myth, the plugin that \"></noscript></a><figcaption>Leggo My Myth, the plugin that \"dares to be silly\"</figcaption></figure><p>The Myth games (especially the first two) enjoyed a significant online following for many years after their respective releases, and the diversity of user-created content available for Myth can attest to this fact. Many well-received maps and modifications were created for the original game, though the release of Myth II and its associated Fear &amp; Loathing map/tagset editors ushered in a boom in user-created Myth content, much of which dramatically altered the source material. Additional maps for the game's multiplayer were far and away the most common type of user content, but the months following Myth II's release would also see many wildly ambitious fan projects. This included efforts like <a href=\"http://tain.totalcodex.net/items/show/blue-and-grey\" rel=\"nofollow \">Blue &amp; Grey</a>, the WWII series of maps, and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-15740\" href=\"/green-berets/3030-15740/\" slug=\"green-berets\">Green Berets</a> (released as a full retail product), which each completely replaced the game's original units, thus drastically altering its gameplay. Several elaborate single-player plugins emerged as well (such as Jinn and Chimera, the latter of which had its story canonized by Bungie) which rivaled the quality of the official campaigns. Even more than a decade after Myth's debut, plugins continue to be developed for Myth stalwarts to enjoy, thought the flow of new releases has understandable reduced to a trickle.</p><p>This fan dedication to the franchise would be taken a step further in 2001 when Take-Two effectively ceased all support for Myth games. In a highly unusual move that was facilitated by Myth III developer Andrew Meggs, Take-Two bequeathed the Myth source code to the community, essentially allowing them to be stewards of the franchise in their stead. What followed was the creation of a group known as the Myth Developers, a group of Myth fans whose purpose was to continue to update all three games in the series. The Myth Devs and other later groups have released several patches for all three games which, among other things, fix various bugs and keep the games compatible with current operating systems. Fan patches at present are developed and released by <a href=\"http://projectmagma.net/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Project Magma</a>.</p><h2>Bungie.net &amp; Beyond</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/1968108-bungienetlogo.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1968108\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.21232876712329\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:21.2%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/1968108-bungienetlogo.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1968108\"><img alt=\"The Bungie.net logo\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 146px) 100vw, 146px\" data-width=\"146\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/11/118253/1968108-bungienetlogo.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/11/118253/1968108-bungienetlogo.png 146w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Bungie.net logo\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/11/118253/1968108-bungienetlogo.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/11/118253/1968108-bungienetlogo.png 146w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 146px) 100vw, 146px\" data-width=\"146\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Bungie.net logo</figcaption></figure><p>The popularity of Myth in its heyday was due in no small part to Bungie.net, Bungie Software's free multiplayer service. Akin to <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1088\" href=\"/blizzard-entertainment/3010-1088/\" slug=\"blizzard-entertainment\">Blizzard</a>'s <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2077\" href=\"/battlenet/3015-2077/\" slug=\"battlenet\">Battle.net</a>, which offered players a quick and easy way to jump into multiplayer <a data-ref-id=\"3030-13062\" href=\"/starcraft/3030-13062/\" slug=\"starcraft\">StarCraft</a> skirmishes, Bungie.net was intended to allow Myth players an intuitive and user-friendly means of approaching the game's multiplayer. Many active multiplayer clans sprouted and flourished within Bungie.net, and frequent tournaments (both official and otherwise) in addition to a complete player ranking system fostered a competitive atmosphere, while a number of casually-oriented unranked lobbies were also available for the less competitively inclined. So crucial was Bungie.net to the success of Myth's community, that many foresaw that the online community would not survive the Take-Two acquisition of the franchise without the presence of Bungie's servers.</p><p>This prediction proved to be both true and untrue. The Myth multiplayer community did survive, though it would be through the recreation of the Bungie.net experience that it would do so. Much like the source code for the games themselves, Bungie.net's server source code was released to fans so that the community could continue. The two most prominent alternatives to Bungie.net to arise after the Take-Two acquisition were PlayMyth.net (now defunct) and <a href=\"http://www.mariusnet.com/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Mariusnet.com</a>. PlayMyth's servers went down in 2007 after server administrator Blades admitted he no longer had the time nor inclination to continue maintaining them, though MariusNet continues to the present day, and has even added support for <a data-ref-id=\"3025-629\" href=\"/marathon/3025-629/\" slug=\"marathon\">Marathon</a>.</p><h2>History of the Myth Universe</h2><h3><u>The Creation of the World</u></h3><p>While the particulars of Myth's genesis are understandably somewhat vague, the prevailing theory posits that the world was born out of the clash of two supremely powerful beings: Wyrd and Nyx. The landscape of the world was first conjured in a dream by Wyrd, which came into being once he awoke. This act supposedly angered Nyx greatly, and the two would spar in a fierce confrontation that could be felt to the very foundation of the world. Certain landmarks, such as the great volcano of Tharsis, are seen by many as evidence of the scars of this battle. Though she fought with rage and ferocity, Nyx would not ultimately succeed in undoing the work of Wyrd. Wyrd would not come away from the fight unscathed, however, as his power, known as the One Dream, was shattered into forty-nine dream fragments which were tossed to the far corners of the world. To this day the fragments of Wyrd's dream are highly sought after by powerful mages, as they allow for the casting of \"dream\" spells which are among the most powerful abilities known to man.</p><h3><u>The Golden Age of the Trow</u></h3><p>All history in Myth before the advent of reliable historical recordkeeping is referred to as the Axe Age. The predominant power at this point in time was the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-5406\" href=\"/trow/3015-5406/\" slug=\"trow\">Trow</a>, who claim to have been created by Nyx herself at the dawn of the world, thus predating all other species. This early period was the height of their civilization, which they refer to as the Golden Age, and the Trow built many colossal temples and monuments in honor of their patron goddess Nyx in this era. Though it is hard to believe in light of their later actions, in the beginning the Trow were peaceful, and did not concern themselves with other races. Though primitive in the eyes of the Trow, other races were allowed to eke out their own existence unmolested.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/1797664-thegreatdevoidmythiii.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1797664\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.43478260869565\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:43.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/1797664-thegreatdevoidmythiii.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1797664\"><img alt=\"The Great Devoid, the somber price of ancient Trow aggression\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/1797664-thegreatdevoidmythiii.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/11/118253/1797664-thegreatdevoidmythiii.png 575w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/118253/1797664-thegreatdevoidmythiii.png 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/1797664-thegreatdevoidmythiii.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Great Devoid, the somber price of ancient Trow aggression\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/1797664-thegreatdevoidmythiii.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/11/118253/1797664-thegreatdevoidmythiii.png 575w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/118253/1797664-thegreatdevoidmythiii.png 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/1797664-thegreatdevoidmythiii.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Great Devoid, the somber price of ancient Trow aggression</figcaption></figure><p>The Trow's accepting attitude toward outsiders would unfortunately undergo an abrupt change when a race known as the Sileh'hei, who mistook their pacifism for weakness, attacked the Trow in a bid to acquire their land. Seeing members of their race die for the first time, the Trow beseeched Nyx for aid, and in response she granted them the gift of iron with which to forge weapons and armor. The Sileh'hei could not have predicted the fury with which the once-passive Trow would retaliate against them. Clad in iron and wielding massive weapons, the Trow pursued their attackers into the bowels of their earthen homes, erasing them from existence. From this point on, the Trow began using iron in their construction to the exclusion of all other materials, building huge smelting forges and deforesting large areas in order to fuel them, which drove many <a data-ref-id=\"3015-5399\" href=\"/forest-giant/3015-5399/\" slug=\"forest-giant\">Forest Giants</a> from their homes. Having experienced victory in battle for the first time, the Trow would soon turn their aggression toward other racess.</p><p>Before long the Trow would begin to covet the young Callieach race, whose magical accomplishments were without equal during the Axe Age. In hopes of claiming the powers and artifacts of the Callieach for themselves, the Trow began what would become a long and brutal siege of the Callieach's territory, raiding their cities and claiming their knowledge in the name of Nyx. The Callieach did not allow the Trow to encroach without penalty, however, and after repeated unheeded warnings to decist they used their magics to plunge the great Trow city of Si'anwon deep into the earth and submerged it under the water of the Western Ocean. Their attack did not have the intended effect on the Trow, who over the years had grown arrogant and contemptuous of the \"lesser\" races. Furious that the Callieach would think to harm them, they redoubled their assault, and in a matter of years the race of mages were brough to the brink of ruin. Despite possessing the power to move mountains, the Callieach could not withstand the might of the Trow. Realizing the end of their civilization was at hand, the Callieach gathered their most powerful magics for one final act of defiance against their aggressors. In their final stand they cast a spell which tore the very fabric of the world asunder. The powerful dream magic they unleashed destroyed the remnants of their race along with countless Trow, transforming the mountainside in the process into a permanent gaping chasm known afterwards as the Great Devoid.</p><h3><u>The First Leveler</u></h3><p>Though the burgeoning human population had thus far avoided drawing the attention of the Trow, and struggled only amongst themselves for power and dominance, humanity would soon come to face its own hardships. The Leveler, a mysterious and powerful being motivated only to conquer and destroy, made his first documented appearance near the start of the Age of Reason some three thousand years before the common era. Though it is often conjectured that The Leveler has beset the world since its very creation, only four incarnations are known by name. The first, Sorangath the Flayed, arose to threaten the fledgling human tribes of early history at a time when they were still scattered and disorganized. Though the threat was dire, it would be a single man, Tireces the Immortal, who would prevent Sorangath from achieving his goal of eradicating mankind. Rallying humanity for the first time into a unified force, Tireces clashed with Sorengath's army, beheaded the fiend in combat while he was magically immobilized, and dispersed his army, later burning his body at the stake. Sorangath's defeat in 570 H.C. is considered the beginning of the Age of Reason, a time of unparalleled prosperity for mankind that would last nearly a millennium. A few years after his battle with The Leveler, Tireces founded the city of Llancarfan (present-day Muirthemne), which in time became the seat of the powerful Cath Bruig Empire.</p><h3><u>The Golden Age of Man</u></h3><p>A few years after his battle with The Leveler, Tireces founded the city of Llancarfan (present-day Muirthemne), which before long became the seat of the powerful Cath Bruig Empire. With The Leveler defeated and the Trow so far showing little interest in their activities, the fortunes of humanity increased many times over during this period. Their population grew, their influence increased, and knowledge of the magic arts spread rapidly, becoming commonplace by the end of the age. It was at this time that the term Avatara was coined to denote only the most skilled of sorcerers, and Mazzarin, the most powerful being to bear the title, was chief among the mages of this period. Many other advancements occurred at this time, such as the creation of a standard calendar (the Acit El, or \"Golden Age\" Calendar).</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/1797602-llancarfan.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1797602\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.64\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:64.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/1797602-llancarfan.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1797602\"><img alt=\"Llancarfan, center of human civilization in the Age of Reason\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/1797602-llancarfan.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/11/118253/1797602-llancarfan.png 500w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/118253/1797602-llancarfan.png 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/1797602-llancarfan.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Llancarfan, center of human civilization in the Age of Reason\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/1797602-llancarfan.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/11/118253/1797602-llancarfan.png 500w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/118253/1797602-llancarfan.png 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/1797602-llancarfan.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Llancarfan, center of human civilization in the Age of Reason</figcaption></figure><p>While it was primarily a time of advancements, humans would face several trials during their Golden Age as well. Since they expanded greatly over a short period of time, men sometimes came into direct conflict with other races. In one of the most notable instances, the fir'Bolg, who fled their homes to escape the Trow much like the Forest Giants had before them, clashed with humans for many years before finally settling in the forests of the Ermine. The pursuit of magic was not without its pitfalls either. As human gained more knowledge of the arcane, conflict soon brewed between those who shunned the dark arts and those who wished to access its secrets. Perhaps the most persistent threat from dark magic came from a necromancer known as Bahl'al (or \"The Watcher\"), who periodically attacked the Cath Bruig throughout the age, returning after long absences with new armies of undead. This eventually led to a violent backlash against magic users, resulting in a dramatic decrease in the number of magi.</p><p>While humans would take great pains to avoid drawing the attention of the Trow, successfully avoiding notice throughout the Age of Reason, another humanoid race, the Oghres, would not be so lucky. After ridiculing the Trow's reverence of the goddess Nyx, the Oghres would pay dearly, learning just how callous and cruel their neighbors were as they were systematically conquered and enslaved for the insult. Forced to toil in the Trow's mines and erect the giant edifices they had once scorned, the Oghres became little more than a race of slaves commanded by the Trow. This event is commonly seen as the end of the Trow's Golden Age, as their race began thereafter to rely increasingly on slave labor and less so on their own accomplishments.</p><h3><u>The Wind Age</u></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/1797601-myrkridianmoonlight.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1797601\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.89473684210526\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:89.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/1797601-myrkridianmoonlight.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1797601\"><img alt=\"Myrkridian persecution paralyzes mankind during the Wind Age.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 285px) 100vw, 285px\" data-width=\"285\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/11/118253/1797601-myrkridianmoonlight.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/11/118253/1797601-myrkridianmoonlight.png 285w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Myrkridian persecution paralyzes mankind during the Wind Age.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/11/118253/1797601-myrkridianmoonlight.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/11/118253/1797601-myrkridianmoonlight.png 285w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 285px) 100vw, 285px\" data-width=\"285\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Myrkridian persecution paralyzes mankind during the Wind Age.</figcaption></figure><p>A thousand years after his greatest triumph, the hero Tireces returned to the world under the Mantle of the Leveler, known thereafter as Moagim the Faceless Terror. Being as black-hearted and savage as Tireces was valiant, Moagim brought vast armies of undead to bear against the Cath Bruig Empire. Though this was the greatest single threat faced by mankind since the appearance of Sorangath the Flayed, the combined magical and martial might humanity had amassed during the Age of Reason allowed them to eventually turn back Moagim's army. Hunted down and captured shortly thereafter, Moagim was drawn and quartered, and his remains were dragged to the four corners of the world, though he laughed maniacally even in the face of his own death.</p><p>Some claim that Moagim was merely responsible for teaching the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-6746\" href=\"/myrkridia/3015-6746/\" slug=\"myrkridia\">Myrkridia</a> how to fight, while others say that in his last moments he gazed into a realm of infinite darkness and summoned them into the world. Whatever the case may be, he was responsible for unleashing them upon man, and thus the nightmare of Moagim endured long after his death as the Myrkridia plagued mankind for nearly one thousand years. Attacking tirelessly and mercilessly under the cover of night, the Myrkridian hordes slowly decimated the human territories, forcing them to cede their lands gradually until only the fortified city of Llancarfan stood as a bastion against their terrible ferocity. In spite of all the advancements made in the previous era, the Myrkridia threatened to erase mankind like so many other civilizations before them, and the Cath Bruig Empire had all but ceased to be.</p><h3><u>The Wolf Age</u></h3><p>In the year 1431 A.E., as the Myrkridia continued to ravage the world, a comet reappeared in the western sky, signalling the return of The Leveler. At the same time, rumors spread of a man from Gower by the name of Connacht the Wolf, a man so fierce in combat that even the Myrkridia feared him. Despite meager defenses, under Connacht's leadership Gower successfully resisted the attacks of the Myrkridia, which brought the barbarian to the attention of Emperor Leitrim. On the strength of these stories as well as the witness of his lieutenant, Damas, the Emperor appointed Connacht the commander of his army in hopes that the Myrkridia might finally be defeated.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/1797600-connacht.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1797600\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/1797600-connacht.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1797600\"><img alt=\"Connacht the Wolf, paragon of the Third Era\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/11/118253/1797600-connacht.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/11/118253/1797600-connacht.png 250w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Connacht the Wolf, paragon of the Third Era\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/11/118253/1797600-connacht.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/11/118253/1797600-connacht.png 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Connacht the Wolf, paragon of the Third Era</figcaption></figure><p>He would go on to accomplish this and more. Connacht turned first to the plight of the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-940\" href=\"/dwarves/3015-940/\" slug=\"dwarves\">Dwarves</a>, who languished under the attack of the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-5401\" href=\"/ghol/3015-5401/\" slug=\"ghol\">Gh\u00f4ls</a>, aiding them in return for a magical artifact known as the <a data-ref-id=\"3055-4660\" href=\"/the-tain/3055-4660/\" slug=\"the-tain\">Tain</a>, which he intended to use as a prison for the Myrkridia. The Tain worked as intended, sealing away scores of Myrkridia and effectively ending their millennial reign. There would be no time to celebreate however, as Moagim the Faceless Terror, progenitor of the Myrkridian scourge, returned mysteriously and immediately fell upon Llancarfan with a new and equally deadly ally: the Trow. After scarcely diverting the destruction of the Imperial city, Connacht traveled deep into the Trow homelands, first inciting their workforce, the Oghres, to rebel against them, and eventually melting their iron cities with an artifact known as the Sun Hammer. The majority of the Trow were trapped in their cities as they were melted into the northern ice, which effectively ended their alliance with Moagim. This came at heavy cost, as the Trow had killed the Oghres to a man, and for the third time an entire race had died at their hands.</p><p>The only obstacle left between Connacht and Moagim was The Watcher himself, the necromancer of the Age of Reason who had killed the great Avatara Mazzarin. Taking up the challenge, the most powerful living sorcerer of the Cath Bruig, Myrdred, defeated Bahl'al and forced him to retreat to the south. This gave Connacht the opportunity he needed to finally face Moagim in single combat, and even the Faceless Terror was not able to withstand him. While it was initially assumed that The Leveler of the Wolf Age was Moagim Reborn, in the aftermath of the final battle it was uncovered that Mjarin, Emperor Leitrim's advisor, had been manipulating events from the shadows, and Connacht was forced to confront and kill him as well. Moagim's body was burned, mixed with salt, and buried under the Mountains of Kor, while the fate of Mjarin's head, which still lived after being separated from its body, is unknown.</p><p>With Leitrim being among those who had died during Moagim's campaign, Connacht the Wolf was crowned the new Emperor of the Cath Bruig, and the remainder of the age was a time of relative calm and prosperity. The Emperor was troubled, however, by the cycle of Light and Dark which was doomed to repeat itself. Fearing that he would return to the world to wreak destruction on those he sought to protect, it was recorded that his later years were spent pursuing and destroying magical artifacts with the aid of his lieutenant Damas. In his final days, it is said that he disappeared into the unknown lands of the east, his final fate a mystery.</p><h3><u>The Great War</u></h3><p>Appearing out of the east in the year 2181 A.E., <a data-ref-id=\"3005-17470\" href=\"/balor/3005-17470/\" slug=\"balor\">Balor</a>, the fourth recorded and most recent incarnation of the Leveler, began gearing for war much earlier than most had anticipated, gradually building a sizable army of undead and vile creatures. In part due to the Twenty Years' War, in which the people of The Province fought in order to have their own ruler independent of the Cath Bruig Empire, Balor was left to consolidate his power uncontested for many years. He drew allies from wherever he could, seducing the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-5404\" href=\"/myrmidon/3015-5404/\" slug=\"myrmidon\">Myrmidon</a> of the Light with promises of immortality, summoning <a data-ref-id=\"3015-5411\" href=\"/fetch/3015-5411/\" slug=\"fetch\">Fetch</a> priestesses from an unknown dimension, and even releasing the Trow from their prison of iron in return for support. Bolstered by seven powerful sorcerer-generals known as the Fallen Lords, Balor made his presence known in 2431 A.E. when he sacked the Cath Bruig capital of Muirthemne, which had stood for three thousand years, and razed the surrounding farmlands, thereafter known as the Barrier. Around the same time, Gh\u00f4ls under Balor's command overran the Dwarven cites of Myrgard and Stoneheim, forcing the dwarves into exhile from their own homeland.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/1797598-balormuirthemne.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1797598\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.89473684210526\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:89.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/1797598-balormuirthemne.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1797598\"><img alt=\"The city of Muirthemne falls to Balor in the early stages of his campaign.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 285px) 100vw, 285px\" data-width=\"285\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/11/118253/1797598-balormuirthemne.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/11/118253/1797598-balormuirthemne.png 285w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The city of Muirthemne falls to Balor in the early stages of his campaign.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/11/118253/1797598-balormuirthemne.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/11/118253/1797598-balormuirthemne.png 285w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 285px) 100vw, 285px\" data-width=\"285\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The city of Muirthemne falls to Balor in the early stages of his campaign.</figcaption></figure><p>Realizing that the overwhelming might of Balor and his Fallen Lords threatened all living existence, the nations of the Light set aside their normal grievances and prejudices, eventually coalescing into a unified army of Dwarves, fir'Bolg, and humans, the most elite of which was known as the Legion. Despite the unprecedented unity of his opponents, Balor was seemingly unstoppable, winning a string of victories until in the year 2480 A.E. only Madrigal still stood in open defiance of him. Desperate for any semblance of an advantage to use against the merciless Balor, the Nine, a group of powerful Avatara and the leaders of the human armies, sought out The Head, an entity who claimed to be one of Balor's oldest enemies. Using his advice, Rabican, one of the Nine, was able to defeat Shiver and halt the siege of Madrigal, which marked the first time a Fallen Lord had been defeated in battle. Encouraged by their recent success, the Avatara soon went in search of the Total Codex at The Head's insistence, and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-18284\" href=\"/alric/3005-18284/\" slug=\"alric\">Alric</a> traveled over the Cloudspine mountain range on a quest for a fabled suit of armor.</p><p>After finding the Codex, the Legion began to move north toward the mountains. Hoping for whatever brief respite from Balor's tireless onslaught they could manage, they decided to hold the mountain passes of Bagrada and Seven gates until they froze over for the winter, forcing their enemies to turn back until spring. Though they were successful in doing so, the unexpected eruption of Tharsis melted the snowy passes, allowing the Fallen Lords to continue their assault unabated. Only an unexpected feud between The Watcher and The Deciever saved the Legion from annihilation. The following spring, the Legion would return to Forest Heart to plead their case to the Forest Giants, who had helped them against Balor in years past. They succeeding in reenlisting their aid, most likely due to the reappearance of the Trow, whom the Forest Giants despised. Before they could fully capitalize, however, Soulblighter emerged in Forest Heart with the Tain, imprisoning the Legion within it.</p><p>The Legion would eventually escape from the Tain, but not without significant losses, the Avatara Cu Roi and Murgen among them. By this time it had also come to light that The Head had been feeding them dubious information for some time, and a civil war erupted as many came to The Head's defense. With the Legion's numbers dwindling and the news of Madrigal's fall fresh in the air, Alric begins leading the remains of the armies of the Light on a suicidal march on Balor's fortress, the ancient Trow city of Rhi'anon, Balor's. Using the Legion's meager 2,200 troops as bait for his gambit, Alric takes a select group of men via World Knot to a place just within Balor's sight and plants a Myrkridian battle standard, hoping that Balor, who was previously Connacht, would be so incensed by this that he would come to personally deal with him. The plan worked, and when Balor confronted him Alric took from his cloak an Eblis Stone which held Balor immobile long enough for Alric's men to sever his head. All that was left to do was throw Balor's head into the Great Devoid so that he could never be resurrected. Though Soulbighter attempted to put a stop to this and save his master, the head was indeed thrown into the Great Devoid, and the armies of the Dark collapsed as the Devoid was consumed in a massive blast.</p><h3><u>Soulblighter's War</u></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/1797599-soulblighterstrand.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1797599\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.89473684210526\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:89.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/1797599-soulblighterstrand.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1797599\"><img alt=\"Soulblighter leaves no man alive during his hunt for the Summoner.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 285px) 100vw, 285px\" data-width=\"285\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/11/118253/1797599-soulblighterstrand.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/11/118253/1797599-soulblighterstrand.png 285w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Soulblighter leaves no man alive during his hunt for the Summoner.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/11/118253/1797599-soulblighterstrand.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/11/118253/1797599-soulblighterstrand.png 285w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 285px) 100vw, 285px\" data-width=\"285\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Soulblighter leaves no man alive during his hunt for the Summoner.</figcaption></figure><p>In the aftermath of the Great War, Alric took up the throne of the Province in Madrigal, and the whole of the world began the task of restoring some sense of normalcy after countless years of war. Unbeknownst to all, Soulblighter, who had been assumed dead after Balor's defeat, was in fact alive, and was furthermore spending his time scheming and growing in power in order to bring ruination to the lands of men. In the year 2540 A.E., some sixty years after Balor's head was thrown into the Great Devoid, undead began to be reported in the area surrounding Forest Heart, and not long after it was revealed that Soulbighter was behind these recent appearances. Upon being informed of this, Alric immediately realized that Soulbighter sought to resurrect the Myrkridia as was foretold by the Total Codex. Hoping to prevent him from doing so, Alric immediately sends a contingent to retrieve the book. Though they were successful, retrieving the Codex did not prevent Soulbighter from finding a means to unleash the Myrkridia, and soon Alric's army was forced to retreat to Tandem in the north as Tyr, Covenant, and Scales quickly succumb to forces of Soulblighter and the recently resurrected Shiver..</p><p>Though the situation was dire, through a series of bold moves King Alric was able to reverse the fortunes of the armies of the Light, first seeking out and reviving The Deceiver, and then retrieving the Ibis Crown from Muirthemne. Upon being resurrected, The Deceiver agrees to aid Alric, travelling to the heart of the Tain where he finds and kills the Summoner, the man who allowed Soulblighter to build his army of Myrkridia. Alric himself retakes Muirthemne, and is crowned the Emperor of the Cath Bruig, thus gaining the allegiance of the Heron Guard. With Soulblighter lacking Myrkridian reinforcements and Alric now aided by the Heron Guard as the new Cath Bruig Emperor, the tables have quickly turned. Soulblighter is soon pinned down near the Cloudspine for a final confrontation, and as it becomes apparent that he is on the losing end, he retreats into the Eye of Tharsis, planning to shatter the Cloudspine mountains, which would cause incalculable damage. He is thwarted in this as well, as Alric pursues and defeats him before he has time to finish his spell.</p><h3><u>An Uncertain Future</u></h3><p>In the wake of Soulblighter's defeat, it is theorized by many that the cycle of Light and Dark has ended, and that men will no longer be subjected to the caprice of The Leveler. If the nature of the cycle was to be believed, Balor was meant to have ushered in a thousand years of darkness, and his failure to do so leaves the cycle itself in question. Though there are many theories on the topic, it will likely be another nine hundred years before anyone truly knowns what lasting impact, if any, the victory of the Light during the Sword Age will have over the cycle.</p><h2>Influences</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/1968137-theblackcompany.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1968137\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5151515151515\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/1968137-theblackcompany.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1968137\"><img alt=\"Myth shares many traits of The Black Company.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/1968137-theblackcompany.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/11/118253/1968137-theblackcompany.png 330w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/1968137-theblackcompany.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Myth shares many traits of The Black Company.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/1968137-theblackcompany.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/11/118253/1968137-theblackcompany.png 330w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/1968137-theblackcompany.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Myth shares many traits of The Black Company.</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to the general debt it owes to <a data-ref-id=\"3040-47777\" href=\"/j-r-r-tolkien/3040-47777/\" slug=\"j-r-r-tolkien\">Tolkien</a>'s <a data-ref-id=\"3035-193\" href=\"/middle-earth/3035-193/\" slug=\"middle-earth\">Middle-earth</a> fantasy setting, the Myth narrative seems to draw more specific inspiration from the <i>Black Company</i> series by Glen Cook. Both works not only make significant use of the first person, but are also told from the perspective of a competent if unspectacular soldier within an elite military unit. A sense of dread likewise permeates both worlds, which is brought on as mortal men are frequently forced into the close proximity of powerful evil entities far beyond their understanding. Many of the groups represented in Cook's novels have some manner of analogue within Myth. The Legion, for instance, can be seen as a replacement for the Black Company itself, while <a data-ref-id=\"3015-7197\" href=\"/the-fallen-lords/3015-7197/\" slug=\"the-fallen-lords\">The Fallen Lords</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3015-7195\" href=\"/the-nine/3015-7195/\" slug=\"the-nine\">The Nine</a> stand in for The Ten Who Were Taken and The Circle of Eighteen respectively. One of the six Fallen Lords mentioned prior to TFL's release (The Faceless One) even shared his name with one of the Taken, further cementing the comparison.</p><p>Though the similarities of the two are heavy, the contributions of <i>The Black Company</i> to the Myth franchise are primarily one of tone, as the actual stories told within each are quite divergent. An oppressive atmosphere is present in both, though the Black Company itself is a mercenary unit which is not opposed to fighting alongside ancient evils when the situation demands, whereas the The Legion of Myth is composed of the most valiant of men who stand staunchly aligned against The Fallen Lords and any other evil force that may threaten man.</p><h2>Resources</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.mariusnet.com/\" rel=\"nofollow \">MariusNet.com</a> - The current multiplayer portal for all Myth games</li><li><a href=\"http://myth.bungie.org/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Myth@Bungie.org</a> - A surprisingly extensive archive for Myth lore and fan speculation</li><li><a href=\"http://www.mythjournals.com/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Mythjournals.com</a> - The entire story line of Myth and Myth II presented in a slick online format</li><li><a href=\"http://projectmagma.net/\" rel=\"nofollow \">ProjectMagma.net</a> - An accomplished mapmaking group and the current stewards of the Myth source code</li><li><a href=\"http://tain.totalcodex.net/\" rel=\"nofollow \">The Tain</a> - A repository for Myth files of all types, from films and patches, to maps and total conversions</li></ul>", "guid": "3025-521", "name": "Myth"}, {"description": "<p>The Medievil series follows the adventures of Sir Daniel Fortesque and his quest to stop Zarok. <br/>Medievil is primarily an action game but has strong puzzle elements as well.

Mega Man, like most of the more popular NES games in the 80s, was a platformer. The pitch with Mega Man was that each world had a different theme and was ruled by a different robot master. At the end of the world, the player would face off against the ruling robot master and in turn, inherit its powers. In order to get through some of the worlds, the player would require a power from one of the different robot masters. For example, in order to defeat Fire Man, the player required the Ice Slasher from Ice Man. <a href=\"/capcom/3010-367/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-367\">Capcom</a> assigned <a href=\"/keiji-inafune/3040-35794/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-35794\">Keiji Inafune</a> to design the characters and designs for the game, even though this was Inafune's first year at Capcom. Over time, Mega Man would be seen as one of the greatest video games of all-time. However, at the time, the game sold poorly and audiences were left unimpressed. Despite this, Capcom began production on <a href=\"/mega-man-2/3030-14026/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14026\">Mega Man 2</a>. The sequel was seen as a side project where developers would use their free time in between developing other Capcom games to work on Mega Man 2. The team reused some of the unused assets from the original and on December 24, 1988, Mega Man 2 was released in Japan, just over a year after the original. The game was later released in North America in July of 1989 and was universally acclaimed. The game sold more than 1.5 million copies and is still to this date, the best selling Mega Man game of all-time. Mega Man had hit the big time.</p><p>Naturally, as the popularity grew, the influx of games increased. <a href=\"/mega-man-3/3030-4518/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4518\">Mega Man 3</a> was released for the NES on September 28, 1990 in Japan and then released one month later in North America. Like Mega Man 2, the third installment was met with universal acclaim and sold over 1 million copies. Due to the popularity of the game and the franchise, the game was included in Nintendo's PlayChoice-10 arcade machines shortly after its release. Also in 1990, a Mega Man game for the DOS was released in the United States-only. Though the game was simply called Mega Man, it was not the same as the 1987 NES game. This DOS version was developed by Hi-Tech Expressions, a children's game company. The game was received poorly by audiences and critics due to its differences from the original series. This began a span where Capcom would capitalize on Mega Man's popularity by marketing it to the mass public.</p><p>In December 1991, the first handheld Mega Man game was released on the Game Boy. Entitled <a href=\"/mega-man-dr-wilys-revenge/3030-17134/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17134\">Mega Man in Dr. Wily's Revenge</a>, the game strangely used the same box art as the DOS Mega Man game, which itself was simply a cropped version of the Mega Man 3 box art. In January 1992, <a href=\"/mega-man-4/3030-8141/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8141\">Mega Man 4</a> was released on the NES. The game was originally planned to be developed on Nintendo's soon to be revealed <a href=\"/snes/3055-2795/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2795\">Super Nintendo</a> but Capcom decided against waiting and put off Mega Man's premiere on the SNES until a later date. Around the same time as the release of Mega Man 4, <a href=\"/mega-man-ii/3030-14547/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14547\">Mega Man II</a> was released on the Game Boy. Though it shared its name with the NES game, Mega Man II on the Game Boy was different from the NES classic and was, in turn, much more like a sequel to Mega Man in Dr. Wily's Revenge.</p><p>In December 1992, <a href=\"/mega-man-5/3030-1223/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1223\">Mega Man 5</a> was released on the NES. At the same time, <a href=\"/mega-man-iii/3030-29264/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-29264\">Mega Man III</a> was released on the Game Boy. The Game Boy titles had since established themselves as a whole other series with Roman numerals differentiating the series from the main games on the console. Confusing matters even more is that in the same year, the second Mega Man for the DOS was released as Mega Man 3. The game shared no similarities to the NES Mega Man 3 or the Game Boy version and was a completely different game. For whatever reason, Capcom decided to skip Mega Man 2 on the DOS and had essentially three different Mega Man series running simultaneously.</p><p>In January 1993, a spin-off Mega Man game was released in Japan-only entitled <a href=\"/wily-right-no-rockboard-thats-paradise/3030-829/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-829\">Wily &amp; Right no RockBoard: That's Paradise</a> for the Famicon. As you can tell from the poorly translated name, this game never made it to North America, though a Game Boy version was in the work and subsequently cancelled. In December 1993, <a href=\"/mega-man-iv/3030-10629/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10629\">Mega Man IV</a> was released on the Game Boy and in March 1994, Mega Man 6 was released on the NES. However, in North America, <a href=\"/mega-man-6/3030-16475/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16475\">Mega Man 6</a> was published by Nintendo because Capcom had originally planned not to release Mega Man 6 outside of Japan due to the dwindling life-span of the NES. In January 1994, <a href=\"/mega-man-x/3030-9463/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9463\">Mega Man X</a> was released, as the first installment in the new X franchise that would soon begin to take the spotlight from the classic Mega Man series.</p><p>In March 1994, <a href=\"/mega-man-soccer/3030-11496/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11496\">Mega Man Soccer</a> was released on the SNES. This was the first non-traditional Mega Man game released in the U.S, the only other at the time being Wily &amp; Right no RockBoard: That's Paradise. Later that year, <a href=\"/mega-man-v/3030-15447/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15447\">Mega Man V</a> was released on the Game Boy, which would end up being the last installment in the Game Boy Mega Man series as Mega Man X continued to take over. In an attempt to broaden Capcom's audience, a series of remakes was released on the <a href=\"/genesis/3045-6/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-6\">Sega Genesis</a> entitled <a href=\"/mega-man-wily-wars/3030-20206/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20206\">Mega Man: The Wily Wars</a>. This only saw a traditional release in Japan and Europe, while the U.S. only saw a release through Sega's monthly subscription Sega Channel program. This would be the only Mega Man to ever be released on the Genesis.</p><p><a href=\"/mega-man-7/3030-7391/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7391\">Mega Man 7</a> was released in September 1995 on the SNES, continuing Capcom's yearly installments in the Mega Man franchise. Also that year, Mega Man saw its first arcade release since Mega Man 3's port, in the form of <a href=\"/mega-man-the-power-battle/3030-21489/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21489\">Mega Man: The Power Battle</a>, though it was only released in Japan. 1995 also saw the release of the only Mega Man game on the <a href=\"/game-gear/3045-5/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-5\">Sega Game Gear</a>, simply entitled Mega Man, the game has become increasingly rare and has become one of the most prized cartridges for the Game Gear.</p><p>The next year, Capcom released another arcade game in Japan as the sequel to The Power Battle, entitled <a href=\"/mega-man-2-the-power-fighters/3030-22879/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-22879\">Mega Man 2: The Power Fighters</a>. 1996 also saw Mega Man celebrating its 10th anniversary by officially leaving Nintendo consoles, releasing Mega Man 8 on Sony's <a href=\"/playstation/3045-22/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-22\">PlayStation</a> and Sega's <a href=\"/saturn/3045-42/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-42\">Saturn</a>. It was also the first Mega Man game to be released on two consoles at launch. However, in a way, the 10th anniversary of Mega Man marked the death of the franchise, as the next year was the first year since the series started that no new traditional Mega Man was released on consoles. Capcom had finally abandoned the traditional Mega Man series instead finding success in the <a href=\"/mega-man-x/3025-524/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-524\">Mega Man X</a> series and beginning the new <a href=\"/mega-man-legends/3025-1050/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1050\">Mega Man Legends</a> series. Instead Capcom released Mega Man Battle &amp; Chase in Japan and Europe as the first 3D installment in the series and the first racing game in the series as well, though the game would never see a U.S. release. In fact, the U.S. would not see a traditional release in the Mega Man for the next 5 years, though Mega Man X and Legends games were being released steadily in other territories. Over the next five years, Capcom would port every traditional Mega Man release to the PlayStation in Japan, as well as released on the Neo Geo Pocket Color, the PC and mobile phones.</p><p>The next Mega Man game released in the U.S. was <a href=\"/mega-man-bass/3030-13218/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13218\">Mega Man &amp; Bass</a> on the <a href=\"/game-boy-advance/3045-4/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-4\">Game Boy Advance</a>, though this was essentially a remake of the Japan-only SNES release Rockman &amp; Forte. A few bad mobile phone ports later, the next console Mega Man game was released on June 22, 2004 on the Nintendo GameCube and PlayStation 2, but even this was not an original game. Instead, it was <a href=\"/mega-man-anniversary-collection/3030-6141/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6141\">Mega Man Anniversary Collection</a>, which featured Mega Man 1-8, as well as the two arcade Mega Man games previously only released in Japan. The compilation was later ported in the Xbox as well.</p><p>2 years later, the next Mega Man was released on the PlayStation Portable entitled <a href=\"/mega-man-powered-up/3030-16360/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16360\">Mega Man Powered Up</a>. However, once again, this was not an original Mega Man game. Instead, it was a remake of the original Mega Man with a new cartoony art style. However, in 2008, the first original Mega Man game in 12 years was released in <a href=\"/mega-man-9/3030-20975/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20975\">Mega Man 9</a>. Mega Man 9 was released on the <a href=\"/wii/3045-36/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-36\">Nintendo Wii</a>, <a href=\"/playstation-3/3045-35/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-35\">PlayStation 3</a> and <a href=\"/xbox-360/3045-20/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-20\">Xbox 360</a>, though as a downloadable game on all platforms. The game saw the franchise return to 8-bit form and was the traditional Mega Man game that most fans of the series had been waiting for for a very long time. On March 1, 2010, <a href=\"/mega-man-10/3030-29413/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-29413\">Mega Man 10</a> was released on Wiiware and eventually PSN and XBLA as an entirely new game with classic 8-bit visuals. By this time, however, the classic Mega Man franchise had all but died and the series had branched off into six different sub-series that had taken the spotlight away from the original Mega Man series.</p><p><a href=\"/mega-man-legends/3025-1050/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1050\">Mega Man Legends</a> featuring the protagonist <a href=\"/mega-man-volnutt/3005-4054/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4054\">MegaMan Volnutt</a>.</p>", "guid": "3025-523", "name": "Mega Man"}, {"description": "<h2>Overview</h2>Mega Man X is the second Mega Man franchise.

With X's help, Dr. Cain created a new race of robots called Reploids. For a time, there was peace.<br/><br/>Later, a virus began spreading among the Reploids that caused them to turn against humanity. The evil reploids are called Mavericks and a group called the Maverick Hunters is formed to combat them.

Each monster can be hunted, with many recurring in specific titles. These represent the most critical part of the gameplay loop in the core Monster Hunter franchise: hunt monsters, carve their hides, create better weapons and armor with their remains, repeat or progress to harder, stronger monsters.</p><p>Monsters can be broadly divided into Small Monsters and Large Monsters.</p><p>Small Monsters are common and can be found throughout missions. They range from peaceful to aggressive and are generally nuisances or methods to obtain low-level gear.</p><p>Large Monsters are reminiscent of boss battles in more traditional games and represent targets of hunts.</p><p>Monsters are divided into Classes, which typically denote their strength. These are:</p><ul><li><strong>Lynian</strong> - Cat-like monsters which steal your goods</li><li><strong>Herbivore</strong> - Generally peaceful monsters which can be hunted for meat and other necessities</li><li><strong>Fish</strong> - Fish which can be hunted. Similar to herbivores, there are a few aggressive carnivorous fish.</li><li><strong>Wingdrake</strong> - Small wyverns, often resembling birds or pterosaurs. Using a grappling hook, a wingdrake can be hooked onto and used as a method of transportation.</li><li><strong>Neopteron</strong> - Insectoid monsters known for their rigid carapaces. These monsters can range in size from tiny to enormous, and some species can fly, while others cannot. Their materials are often used to make very sharp weapons.</li><li><strong>Temnoceran</strong> - Characterized by its arachnoid characteristics, such as the ability to produce silk, though they have six limbs.</li><li><strong>Bird Wyvern</strong> - Small to medium sized class that includes Flying with slender bodies that are bipedal and, in some cases, either have wings or lack wings. They are generally the first major hunts fought in a game.</li><li><strong>Flying Wyvern</strong> - Large, bipedal monsters known for their mastery of flight, a majority of the monsters in this classification have evolved powerful wings that allow them to fly. Flying Wyverns make up a large majority of the monsters in the Monster Hunter franchise.</li><li><strong>Piscine Wyvern</strong> - Made up of wyvern-like fish that have evolved to be specialized in swimming in just about anything, mainly water, and that lack the ability to fly.</li><li><strong>Carapaceon</strong> - Crustacean- or scorpion-like monsters that have hard shells and exoskeletons or crab-like bodies, which mostly require weapons with at least green sharpness to break. Most of these crustaceans resemble crabs, lobsters or scorpions.</li><li><strong>Amphibian</strong> - Superficially frog-like in body structure, with powerful, spring-like back legs and muscular forelegs. They are known to inhabit a diverse range of environments and are typically carnivorous.</li><li><strong>Fanged Beast</strong> - Beastly mammalian creatures that operate with only legs, and no wings. They are often much faster than other larger threats.</li><li><strong>Leviathan</strong> - Large wyverns that are specialized in swimming. Leviathans are known to usually be the top predators of their environments like Flying Wyverns.</li><li><strong>Snake Wyvern</strong> - Known for their serpentine features, such as long, coiling bodies and forked tongues. They can range dramatically in both size and overall body structure, with some members being large, serpentine land-dwellers, while others are smaller and more reminiscent of Flying Wyverns.</li><li><strong>Brute Wyvern</strong> - Greatly resembling real-life theropods, these monsters are well adapted for life on land, using their powerful hindlimbs to get around from place to place rather than using wings or other means to travel.</li><li><strong>Fanged Wyvern</strong> - Known for being Fanged Beast-like Wyvern monsters that have highly developed limbs.</li><li><strong>Elder Dragon</strong> - Unlike other monster types, which classify monsters by shared traits, Elder Dragons are creatures that defy typical classification and sit outside of the standard ecosystem, regardless of any superficial resemblance to a dragon. These monsters are usually rare creatures with immense power that have lived since ancient times, making them more of a phenomenon than a mere animal; disasters, cataclysms, living forces of nature. In other words, the toughest monsters in any given game.</li><li><strong>Unknown (???)</strong> - A special class applying to Gore Magala and its offshoots for story reasons.</li><li><strong>Relict</strong> - A special class applying to Leshen and Ancient Leshen as part of a crossover with \"<a href=\"/the-witcher/3025-1495/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1495\">The Witcher</a>\" series.</li></ul><h3>Monsters Introduced in the First Generation</h3><p>The first generation of Monster Hunter introduced a number of series staples, such as Aptonoth, Rathalos, Rathian, and Diablos, all of whom have reappeared in every subsequent generation.</p><p>There were 45 monsters introduced, with 14 Small Monsters and 31 Large Monsters.</p><h4>Small Monsters:</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17380/3289740-aptonoth.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3289740\" data-ratio=\"0.52750809061489\" data-width=\"309\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 309px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:52.8%\" href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17380/3289740-aptonoth.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3289740\"><img alt=\"Peaceful herbivores, or your next meal?\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17380/3289740-aptonoth.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17380/3289740-aptonoth.jpg 309w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 309px) 100vw, 309px\" data-width=\"309\"></a><figcaption>Peaceful herbivores, or your next meal?</figcaption></figure><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17380/3289782-aptonoth.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3289782\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"70\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 70px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17380/3289782-aptonoth.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3289782\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 70px) 100vw, 70px\" data-width=\"70\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17380/3289782-aptonoth.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17380/3289782-aptonoth.png 70w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17380/3289782-aptonoth.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17380/3289782-aptonoth.png 70w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 70px) 100vw, 70px\" data-width=\"70\"></noscript></a></figure><p><strong>Aptonoth</strong> (Herbivore) - Docile creatures that are hunted for their meat by humans and other monsters.

Rathian, along with Rathalos, are the only monsters to appear in every Monster Hunter entry to date.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17380/3289832-pinkrathian.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3289832\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"70\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 70px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17380/3289832-pinkrathian.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3289832\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 70px) 100vw, 70px\" data-width=\"70\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17380/3289832-pinkrathian.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17380/3289832-pinkrathian.png 70w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17380/3289832-pinkrathian.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17380/3289832-pinkrathian.png 70w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 70px) 100vw, 70px\" data-width=\"70\"></noscript></a></figure><p><strong>Pink Rathian</strong> (Flying Wyvern) - A subspecies of Rathian with vibrant pink scales.

Gravios can also expel flammable gas as a waste product of its 'heat beam', and of its diet.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17380/3289851-blackgravios.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3289851\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"70\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 70px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17380/3289851-blackgravios.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3289851\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 70px) 100vw, 70px\" data-width=\"70\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17380/3289851-blackgravios.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17380/3289851-blackgravios.png 70w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17380/3289851-blackgravios.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17380/3289851-blackgravios.png 70w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 70px) 100vw, 70px\" data-width=\"70\"></noscript></a></figure><p><strong>Black Gravios</strong> (Flying Wyvern) - A Gravios subspecies distinguished by a hard black carapace that allows them to contain their own extraordinarily high internal temperatures.

Despite their predatory appearance, they are herbivorous and mostly feed on cactus. Diablos are known to use their horns as weapons against attackers, but will also use them in bouts against other Diablos in battles for territory or mating rights. Diablos typically avoid flight for the purpose of transportation, as a disproportionally high mass prevents them from effectively flying for long periods of time. Instead, Diablos will use their wings to free themselves when trapped in the sand. In addition, they are capable of producing a powerful roar that will stun most aggressors.

Kirin can summon lightning to strike attackers or the area around it. When Kirin is threatened or provoked, it can wreath itself in lightning, which is proven to harden it's hide. Kirin has very few physical attacks and relies mostly on lightning strikes as it's main force of attacking foes. Kirin appear to be relatively peaceful and passive creatures. Using their extreme agility, Kirin can literally run circles around their opponent, getting in close to gore an enemy with their horn, only to quickly dart away and prepare another assault. Kirin are very mobile and can jump and run incredible distances in short amounts of time.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17380/3289868-lao-shanlung.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3289868\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"70\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 70px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17380/3289868-lao-shanlung.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3289868\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 70px) 100vw, 70px\" data-width=\"70\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17380/3289868-lao-shanlung.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17380/3289868-lao-shanlung.png 70w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17380/3289868-lao-shanlung.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17380/3289868-lao-shanlung.png 70w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 70px) 100vw, 70px\" data-width=\"70\"></noscript></a></figure><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17380/3289871-lao-shanlung.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3289871\" data-ratio=\"0.541\" data-width=\"1000\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:54.1%\" href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17380/3289871-lao-shanlung.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3289871\"><img alt=\"Lao-Shan Lung was the first siege raid monster in the series.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/17380/3289871-lao-shanlung.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17380/3289871-lao-shanlung.png 1000w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1/17380/3289871-lao-shanlung.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/17380/3289871-lao-shanlung.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/17380/3289871-lao-shanlung.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Lao-Shan Lung was the first siege raid monster in the series.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/17380/3289871-lao-shanlung.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17380/3289871-lao-shanlung.png 1000w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1/17380/3289871-lao-shanlung.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/17380/3289871-lao-shanlung.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/17380/3289871-lao-shanlung.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Lao-Shan Lung was the first siege raid monster in the series.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Lao-Shan Lung</strong> (Elder Dragon) - A giant dragon that has only been rarely sighted.

Lao-Shan Lung introduces the siege mechanic and was the first massive raid monster in the franchise. They are extremely docile even when facing multiple foes. They appear to care little about Hunters, as they mainly ignore them on their way to the town Fortress. That said, they will put in a great deal of effort to break the fort rather than simply run away. They lack any sort of elemental or special abilities and instead relies solely on its immense physical bulk and strength, being strong enough to smash through huge forts with enough effort and barrel straight through villages and towns without a second thought.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17380/3289870-ashenlao-shanlung.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3289870\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"70\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 70px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17380/3289870-ashenlao-shanlung.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3289870\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 70px) 100vw, 70px\" data-width=\"70\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17380/3289870-ashenlao-shanlung.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17380/3289870-ashenlao-shanlung.png 70w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17380/3289870-ashenlao-shanlung.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17380/3289870-ashenlao-shanlung.png 70w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 70px) 100vw, 70px\" data-width=\"70\"></noscript></a></figure><p><strong>Ashen Lao-Shan Lung</strong> (Elder Dragon) - A giant dragon few have seen and lived to tell the tale. When on the rampage it wreaks havoc on all in its path. Despite its reputation as a Subspecies, Ashen Lao-Shan Lung is actually a regular Lao-Shan Lung which has been exposed to many years of volcanic debris. As a result, its carapace is highly discolored, taking on a muted grey-blue color. They retain the city crushing strength of normal Lao-Shan Lung however their bodies are much harder to penetrate due to the ash and soot solidifying their bodies. Ashen Lao-Shan Lung is extremely docile, only directly attacking creatures that disrupt its feeding. The creature often takes little notice of hunters, but will destroy any structure which stands in its way.<i> </i></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17380/3289873-fatalis.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3289873\" data-ratio=\"0.57659574468085\" data-width=\"470\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 470px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:57.7%\" href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17380/3289873-fatalis.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3289873\"><img alt=\"Fatalis is the final boss of the online portion of the original Monster Hunter \" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/17380/3289873-fatalis.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17380/3289873-fatalis.png 470w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/17380/3289873-fatalis.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Fatalis is the final boss of the online portion of the original Monster Hunter \" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/17380/3289873-fatalis.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17380/3289873-fatalis.png 470w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/17380/3289873-fatalis.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Fatalis is the final boss of the online portion of the original Monster Hunter </figcaption></figure><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17380/3289872-fatalis.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3289872\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"70\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 70px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17380/3289872-fatalis.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3289872\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 70px) 100vw, 70px\" data-width=\"70\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17380/3289872-fatalis.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17380/3289872-fatalis.png 70w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17380/3289872-fatalis.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17380/3289872-fatalis.png 70w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 70px) 100vw, 70px\" data-width=\"70\"></noscript></a></figure><p><strong>Fatalis</strong> (Elder Dragon) - A legendary black dragon said to have prowled these lands from the days of old.

Fatalis is an extremely powerful monster, able to wipe out entire hunting parties with relative ease. Its primary weaponry lies in its flame breath, fabled to have reduced a kingdom to ashes within a single night, which can be utilized to produce either a stream of fire or explosive projectiles. Fatalis is also able to release a cloud of flammable dust and set it alight, similar to Teostra, and it is known to use its whip-like tail and powerful, bone-crushing jaws to defend itself from nearby attackers.

Unlike the common, mostly elemental, runes there also exists 27 \"True Runes.\" These runes are thought to be bestow their users with god-like powers, but in return for such great power, they usually have to withstand hardship. The Suikoden games often center around the player character receiving one of these True Runes. Thus far only 18 of these True Runes have been revealed.</p><h2>Legacy</h2><p><a href=\"/deus-ex/3025-146/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-146\">Deus Ex</a> creator <a href=\"/warren-spector/3040-2978/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-2978\">Warren Spector</a> has credited Suikoden, particularly the first <a href=\"/suikoden/3030-8810/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8810\">Suikoden</a>, as a big influence on his work, even as early as the first <a href=\"/deus-ex/3030-17533/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17533\">Deus Ex</a> (see <a href=\"http://www.siliconera.com/2012/11/10/how-suikoden-influenced-deus-ex-and-epic-mickey/\" rel=\"nofollow \" data-ref-id=\"false\">here </a>and <a href=\"http://youtu.be/HOPHmbulMp4?t=37m30s\" rel=\"nofollow \" data-ref-id=\"false\">here</a>). He stated that the limited <a href=\"/moral-decisions/3015-93/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-93\">moral choices</a> in the game, some of which turn out to be false choices, are what inspired him to explore the concept much further and attempt to offer meaningful choices that actually matter.

This event spawned the phrase \"going postal\". The first in the series was an isometric shooter simply named \"Postal\". In this game you play a character simply known as the postal dude who for unknown reasons (due to the presence of a moving van and police cars it could be eviction) is going postal and believes the world is out to get him. This game is the only of its kind that is set in stone, meaning the player isn't in control of how much violence since you have to kill a certain amount of characters to advance.</p><p>The second, Postal\u00b2 is what gained the series its notoriety of being over the top and blatantly psychotic. This game the player takes control of The Postal Dude jr. for a five day week in the mining town of Paradise, AZ who has a knack for attracting trouble, attention, and bullets. In this game you have the ability to commit lewd acts such as pissing on corpses, complete dismemberment, live cremation, and disembowelment. It has been said that because of this fact the game is tasteless but the violence is mostly left up to the player. The game does seem to encourage the violence by putting all odds against you and literally having everyone you run into want you dead. The missions in this game include mundane tasks, like getting milk or going to confession, but puts all sort of obstacles, such as al qaeda extremists or murderous protesters, directly in the way. Critically it usually gets a 50% with lot's of mixed reviews (negative reviews mostly directed towards the violence, extremely long load times, and disgusting nature of the game and positive reviews go for the amazing amount of cajones actually needed to create a game and circle it into existence) and the game is noted for having a very large cult following but technically it all depends on the type of gamer you are. I'd recommend looking on youtube for a video of gameplay before you purchase it.</p><p>There was an expansion pack created (known as Apocalypse weekend) and a plethora of mods (such as eternal damnation and a weed in paradise) created. The expansion expands the game (from Monday to Friday) to the last remaining days of the week. It again follows dude on his exploits after being shot in the head, getting his trailer repossessed, his dog sent to the pound, and his wife leaving him as he try's to get away from all the psycho's and zombies in Paradise, save his dog, get his trailer, and get the hell out of town. This was the last official game in the series released thus far but a sequel is in production.</p><p>Postal III is going to be the third installment and once again follow T. P. Dude jr. as he tries to start a new life in Catharsis, AZ (sister town of paradise) as he's dragged through hell again just trying to live a normal life.</p><p>There were a couple of spin offs such as the cellphone game Postal Babes and a couple of other under the radar games. All the games were developed and copyrighted by running with scissors and the third is a joint operation with Akella soft.</p><h2>Awards and Honors</h2><h3>2009</h3><ul><li>Gamepro Magazine Top 6 Goriest Headshots: 5th Place Winner - POSTAL 2</li><li>Playground.ru Top 10 Funniest Games Ever: 1st Place Winner - POSTAL 2</li><li>AskMen.com Top 10 Most Violent Games Ever: 1st Place Winner - POSTAL 2</li><li>Yahoo Most Controversial Games Ever: 5th Place - POSTAL</li><li>Mobile VAS Awards: 1st Place Winner - POSTAL Babes Mobile</li><li>Project Next Gaming: Silver Award 87/100 - POSTAL Babes Mobile</li></ul><h3>2008</h3><ul><li>Findmysoft.com: Certificate of Excellence Award - POSTAL II</li><li>Joystiq.com: Best Weapon of E3, RWS Badger Saw! - POSTAL III</li><li>Hoboken International Film Festival: Best Of Show. \u2013 Postal The Movie</li></ul><h3>2007</h3><ul><li>Voted one of top 10 best games at Igromir Expo - POSTAL III</li><li>XLeague, Top 10 Video Game Weapons, Postal 2 #3, Anthrax Cow Head!</li><li>Gamesradar, The 10 Most Banned Video Games, Postal #1, banned in 13 Countries!</li><li>Consoletech, Innovative Achievement Award - RWS &amp; POSTAL Series</li></ul><h3>2006</h3><ul><li>PC World, The 10 Worst Games of All Time, Runners-Up - POSTAL</li></ul><h3>2005</h3><ul><li>Mirror.co.uk, Sickest TOP 5, POSTAL 2: Apocalypse Weekend #5</li></ul><h3>2004</h3><ul><li>Holiday Violent Games List, POSTAL 2, #9</li><li>Interfaith Alliance top 10 most violent games list - POSTAL 2</li><li>Nexus Game Magazine, Top 10 Controversial Games - POSTAL 2</li><li>PC Zone (UK), Rated Future Filth - POSTAL 2: Share The Pain</li><li>Game Industry News: Nominated Best Action Game of the Year.

The first FPS of the Star Wars Franchise, Dark Forces was critically hailed for it's story, gameplay, and complex level design. Perceived as a Doom clone, but actually excelled past that of Doom, and was considered an excellent game, and not just a bad Doom clone. Perhaps the first game to create it's own Star Wars fiction, Dark Forces introduced the anti-hero <a href=\"/kyle-katarn/3005-721/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-721\">Kyle Katarn</a>.

Despite its' inclusion of ship and artillery not found in the original canon the game failed to reach an audience. Many people criticized the game for it's poor graphics and awkward gameplay while other's praised it for it's emphasis of gameplay over graphics. The game received a spiritual sequel, <a href=\"/star-wars-force-commander/3030-17353/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17353\">Star Wars: Force Commander</a>, in 2000 that also failed to reach an audience.</p><p>Star Wars returned to the PC platform with the release of <a href=\"/star-wars-jedi-knight-dark-forces-ii/3030-7418/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7418\">Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II</a> and <a href=\"/star-wars-x-wing-vs-tie-fighter/3030-15483/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15483\">X-Wing VS. TIE-Fighter</a>. While Dark Forces II received wide praise for it's engrossing gameplay and impressive 3D environments, X-Wing VS. TIE-Fighter was met with lukewarm reception from most of the series fans due to it's lack of storyline and cutscenes. With the release of the first movie in the prequel trilogy, A Phantom Menace, in 1999 the gaming world was flooded with numerous Star Wars movie tie-in games.

Based entirely off of the Age of Kings engine, the game played nearly identically to Age of Empires II. Featuring six different factions with unique weapons and buildings to each, Galactic Battlegrounds is considered one of the best Star Wars entries into the RTS genre. In 2002 an expansion, <a href=\"/star-wars-galactic-battlegrounds-clone-campaigns/3030-20215/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20215\">Clone Campaigns</a>, was released that included two new campaign modes and two new factions.</p><p>In 2002 the second movie of the prequel trilogy, Attack of the Clones, was released in cinemas along with a series of tie-in video games.

There are four primary titles in the franchise, which are, in order of release, Star Wars: X-Wing, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-19727\" href=\"/star-wars-tie-fighter/3030-19727/\" slug=\"star-wars-tie-fighter\">Star Wars: TIE Fighter</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-15483\" href=\"/star-wars-x-wing-vs-tie-fighter/3030-15483/\" slug=\"star-wars-x-wing-vs-tie-fighter\">Star Wars: X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter</a>, and Star Wars: X-Wing Alliance; all games in the series, with the exception of the last, received at least one official expansion as well. Though they differ in the particulars, games in the X-Wing franchise focus primarily on <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2755\" href=\"/dogfight/3015-2755/\" slug=\"dogfight\">dogfighting</a> between spacecraft of the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1006\" href=\"/rebel-alliance/3015-1006/\" slug=\"rebel-alliance\">Rebel Alliance</a> and the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1007\" href=\"/galactic-empire/3015-1007/\" slug=\"galactic-empire\">Galactic Empire</a>, and, apart from X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter, X-Wing titles are known for their lengthy single-player campaigns, which dovetail with the events of the original trilogy.</p><p>The Star Wars: X-Wing franchise directly ties itself not only to canonical Star Wars events, but also to the Stare Wars Expanded Universe with inclusions such as <a data-ref-id=\"3005-6322\" href=\"/grand-admiral-thrawn/3005-6322/\" slug=\"grand-admiral-thrawn\">Grand Admiral Thrawn</a> and the <a data-ref-id=\"3055-4906\" href=\"/z-95-headhunter/3055-4906/\" slug=\"z-95-headhunter\">Z-95 Headhunter</a>. Several new types of spacecraft were also created specifically for the series, such as the <a data-ref-id=\"3055-4900\" href=\"/tie-defender/3055-4900/\" slug=\"tie-defender\">TIE Defender</a> and the <a data-ref-id=\"3055-4901\" href=\"/missile-boat/3055-4901/\" slug=\"missile-boat\">Missile Boat</a>, some of which do not appear outside the X-wing games. The events depicted within the games are on the whole considered to be canonical happenings in the series' fiction, and over the course of its lifespan, X-Wing added a number of new characters to the Star Wars universe, with some of the more notable creations being Maarek Stele and Ace Azzameen, the protagonists of TIE Fighter and X-Wing Alliance, respectively, as well as Grand Admiral Zaarin, who organized an unsuccessful coup d'\u00e9tat against <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2459\" href=\"/emperor-palpatine/3005-2459/\" slug=\"emperor-palpatine\">Emperor Palpatine</a>.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Single-Player</h3><p>The core gameplay of the X-Wing series revolves around simulated combat engagements between spacefaring vessels of the Empire and the Rebellion. During missions, the player controls a single starfighter from a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-330\" href=\"/first-person-perspective/3015-330/\" slug=\"first-person-perspective\">first-person perspective</a>, piloting it through a variety of hostile encounters, which can generally be divided into one of two categories: dogfights occurring between two or more ships of a similar size, or confrontations with larger and more dangerous capital class vessels. To prevail in combat, most ships are equipped both with short range beam weaponry, most commonly Laser Cannons or Ion Cannons, which can be recharged, as well as a limited supply of long range warheads such as Photon Torpedoes or Concussion Missiles, which must be used more judiciously. In addition to fighting off the enemy, the player is often tasked with accomplishing additional objectives in the midst of combat, such as defending a vulnerable allied target or acquiring important data, and furthermore missions may sometimes unfold in phases. Failure of any primary objectives will result in mission failure, as will the destruction of the player's ship.</p><p>Energy management is another crucial gameplay mechanic which must be properly accounted for in most missions. With the exception of some of the Empire's weaker ships, which are unshielded, all starfighters have individual subsystems for engines, shields, and lasers. The player is expected to designate how much power is allotted to each system as their mission demands, and with all systems drawing from the same power source, an importance is placed on finding the right balance between all three necessarily systems, as increasing power to one system directly decreases the amount available to the other two. Extremely advanced vessels may even have a fourth system devoted to an onboard <a data-ref-id=\"3055-1836\" href=\"/tractor-beam/3055-1836/\" slug=\"tractor-beam\">Tractor Beam</a> projector. In emergency situations, stored energy within a specific subsystem may be redirected to boost energy in another, allowing players, for example, to divert weapon energy in order to restore shielding at a faster than normal rate.</p><p>Rather than having a system of save states, the X-Wing games track progress in single-player by way of player profiles, which a new player must create before they are allowed to partake in missions. The profile system not only saves the player's progress, but also keeps track of a number of statistics regarding player performance. Additionally, over the course of the game players can amass various awards and commendations which can be viewed between missions. The intra-mission interface in the X-Wing games was designed to be immersive, as players are required to navigate a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-75\" href=\"/point-and-click/3015-75/\" slug=\"point-and-click\">point-and-click</a> <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1427\" href=\"/2d/3015-1427/\" slug=\"2d\">two-dimensional</a> representation of a starship rather than selecting options from a menu. This in-fiction presentation even at times includes transitional cutscenes to illustrate when a player is traveling from one area to another. It is through this interface that the player not only accesses the main story missions, but also engages in side activities such as training missions and historical simulations.</p><h3>Multiplayer</h3><p>Introduced in X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter, multiplayer operates on the same basic mechanical foundation as the franchise's single-player component while adding support for up to eight simultaneous players in a single scenario. The most basic multiplayer mode is Melee, which essentially consists of <a data-ref-id=\"3015-451\" href=\"/deathmatch/3015-451/\" slug=\"deathmatch\">deathmatch</a>-style dogfights between opposing starships. The second mode, Combat Engagement, is more similar to single-player missions, as matches contain overarching objectives for players to accomplish above and beyond simply destroying enemy fighters. Both Tournament and Battle modes exist as well, which are variants of Melee mode and Combat Engagements. In both cases, players participate in a series of matches rather than a single match, with the victor being determined by overall performance. Lastly, cooperative mission play is also possible, allowing groups of allied players to tackle objective-based missions together. The release of X-Wing Alliance added a race mode called Pilot Proving Grounds as well as a skirmish option that gives players the ability to create custom multiplayer missions.</p><h2>Games</h2><table class=\"t-editor full-width\"><tbody><tr><td><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/334/645507-xwing.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-645507\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.2337962962963\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:123.4%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/334/645507-xwing.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-645507\"><img alt=\"X-Wing\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/334/645507-xwing.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/334/645507-xwing.jpg 432w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/334/645507-xwing.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>X-Wing</figcaption></figure></td><td><h3><a data-ref-id=\"3030-2294\" href=\"/star-wars-x-wing/3030-2294/\" slug=\"star-wars-x-wing\">Star Wars: X-Wing</a> (1993)</h3>Set in the same general time frame as <i>A New Hope</i>, Star Wars: X-Wing's story mode portrays events prior to and in tandem with many of the events of the first movie, culminating in the iconic <a data-ref-id=\"3035-205\" href=\"/death-star/3035-205/\" slug=\"death-star\">Death Star</a> trench run above <a data-ref-id=\"3035-512\" href=\"/yavin-iv/3035-512/\" slug=\"yavin-iv\">Yavin IV</a>, in which the player assumes the role of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1062\" href=\"/luke-skywalker/3005-1062/\" slug=\"luke-skywalker\">Luke Skywalker</a>.

XvT was a significant graphical improvement over the previous games, including hardware acceleration for the first time, though unfortunately it drew criticism from some fans due to the absence of any story-driven single-player campaign akin to those in previous games.

From a gameplay perspective, X-Wing Alliance is primarily notable for allowing players to pilot several freighter-class ships. These larger vessels are differentiated from normal starfighters by heavier shielding and turret-mounted laser weaponry, though they are also far less maneuverable than other ships.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Special Editions</h2><h3>Collector's CD-ROM (1994, 1995)</h3><p>The Collector's CD-ROM editions of X-Wing and TIE Fighter brought various improvements to the core games. Graphically, the engine was upgraded to support 640x480 resolution, and in the case of X-Wing, certain options first introduced in TIE Fighter, such as Gouraud shading, were implemented. Much of the game's interface and cutscene artwork was also altered, and furthermore the audio presentation was significantly enhanced with new sounds and a large amount of additional voice over work for mission briefings. All previously released expansion content came included with the Collector's CD-ROM versions of X-Wing and TIE Fighter by default, and some missions that were judged overly difficult were given optional versions that are somewhat more forgiving.</p><h3>Collector Series (1998)</h3><p>Running on the X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter engine, the Collector Series compiled the first two X-Wing games into one package, while also offering a demo version of XvT called X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter Flight School. The most striking enhancement in the Collector Series is certainly the introduction of hardware-accelerated graphics to X-Wing and TIE Fighter, though it is also worth noting that the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-5845\" href=\"/imuse/3015-5845/\" slug=\"imuse\">iMUSE</a>-guided MIDI compositions used in the original releases were replaced in these versions by Red Book audio tracks of John Williams' Star Wars score. Once again, cutscenes and certain interface elements were redone in the Collector Series to take advantage of more modern capabilities.</p><h3>X-Wing Trilogy (2000)</h3><p>Star Wars: X-Wing Trilogy, the last compilation release of the X-Wing series, included X-Wing, TIE Fighter, X-Wing Alliance, and X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter Flight School. The versions of X-Wing and TIE Fighter included in this package are identical to the iterations that appeared in the earlier Collector Series, and X-Wing Alliance received no noticeable alterations in the transition to the X-Wing Trilogy. Though the games within receive no enhancements past what was previously available, X-Wing Trilogy is the most complete rerelease of the X-Wing games, as it is missing only the full version of XvT and its expansion, Balance of Power.</p>", "guid": "3025-552", "name": "Star Wars: X-Wing"}, {"description": "<p>The Rainbow Six Vegas franchise is a series of first person shooters.

Like with many Star Wars games everyone may have enjoyed the Dark Forces game but fans still wanted to play as a true Jedi. Before the release of Dark Forces, Katarn's continuing story was already being discussed and this included the addition of the force and a lightsaber. </p><p>Despite the clear success of both Dark Forces games a new game wouldn't be released until 2002, a full six years after <a href=\"/star-wars-jedi-knight-dark-forces-ii/3030-7418/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7418\">Dark Forces 2</a>.

The concept was originally to be based off of FBI rescue teams, but later scrapped the idea in favor of a more international unit that was not weighed down to only operating in the <a href=\"/the-united-states-of-america/3035-396/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-396\">United States</a>. The project name was originally called \"Black Ops\" which is actually the term used when nations use special operations that if known, would be considered an act of war, and so must remain discreet. Since Red Storm is a company closely related to <a href=\"/tom-clancy/3025-556/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-556\">Tom Clancy</a>, word had got out that he writing a novel about international terrorism and a unique unit to combat <a href=\"/terrorists/3015-293/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-293\">terrorist</a> threats. The book was entitled Rainbow Six. The Rainbow in the title represents the unification of international forces by NATO, and six is the actual director or overseer of their actions. Red Storm picked up on the idea and renamed their project the same as the novel. Though titled the same the first game's plot was different then the book due to release dates being apart as the game came out first.</p><h2>Tactical Shooter Gameplay</h2><p>As this was a Tom Clancy game, the developers wanted the gameplay to be as real as possible at the time. Rather than have the player play the game like a <a href=\"/run-n-gun/3015-715/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-715\">Run and Gun</a> shooter, R6 emphasized on tactics, critical thinking, squad mechanics, and <a href=\"/stealth/3015-24/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-24\">stealth</a> as a means of completing a mission or level. The reasoning was simply because of the \"one shot, one kill\" factor, in other words, the player could be killed and kill <a href=\"/non-player-character/3015-967/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-967\">NPC's</a> with a few amount of shots at anytime. R6 also incorporated some of the first <a href=\"/squad/3015-667/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-667\">squad</a> mechanics in a video game. Right before most missions the player would choose his teammates, and their gear. It should also be noted that each gun behaved differently much like in real life, some had better long range stats while others were more preferable at mid to close range. also depending on the mission like a <a href=\"/hostages/3015-367/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-367\">hostage</a> rescue, it would be better to carry <a href=\"/silencer/3055-489/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-489\">silenced weapons</a> to avoid detection, to gain an advantage over the enemy NPC's. Multiplayer was relatively the same style gameplay as the single player, which made R6 stand out more from other FPS's at the time increasing it's success as a \"sleeper\" hit. Although ever since <i><a href=\"/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-lockdown/3030-1581/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1581\">Lockdown</a>,</i> the series has become more \"Hollywood\" or more focused on actions, covering, and faster pace gameplay.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p>The plot for most or all the R6 games are usually more along the lines of a terrorist threat on a global or national level and the R6 team tracks and finally neutralizes by the end of the campaign. There have been a few exceptions such as <i><a href=\"/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-critical-hour/3030-11245/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11245\">Critical Hour</a>, <a href=\"/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-vegas/3030-3550/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3550\">Vegas</a> and <a href=\"/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-vegas-2/3030-1986/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1986\">Vegas 2</a>,</i> where the plot is more inclined of the characters and knowing their past, and becoming more focused on their actions rather than \"stop terrorist at point A, B, C, and finally neutralize\" This has so far been where the series has been taking as far as plot goes, while some oppose it, others are unsure or don't particularly mind.</p><h2>Sequels</h2><p>After the \"sleeper\" hit of the first game Red Storm had created the sequel <i><a href=\"/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-rogue-spear/3030-8728/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8728\">R6: Rogue Spear</a>.</i> Fans of the original had been more than pleased with the <a href=\"/sequel/3015-3178/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3178\">sequel</a> as it was merely a update of technology from the first game, and was more heavily focused on the multiplayer aspect of the game. The Game also introduced mods, for the first time in the series, and had later brought <a href=\"/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-covert-ops-essentials/3030-22959/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-22959\"><i>Covert Ops</i></a> and <a href=\"/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-rogue-spear-black-thorn/3030-13603/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13603\"><i>Black Thorn</i></a> as expansion packs. Some consider R6RS to be the prime of the series, while others believed the next sequel <a href=\"/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-3-raven-shield/3030-16073/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16073\"><i>R63: Raven Shield</i></a> to be the best of the series. Raven Shield had done much what Rogue Spear had done but better. The graphics were some of the best at the time, and had made the gameplay more accessible but not too much to discourage the fans who had played the series before. This was later ported to the consoles and was just titled <i>R63</i>. The Xbox version was the most successful and even took advantage of the mic or headset used for <a href=\"/xbox-live/3015-1404/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1404\">Xbox Live</a> as a means of commanding the players teammates in single player. With Xbox Live having been out a little over a year, R63 was the top played Xbox Live game at it's release until <a href=\"/halo-2/3030-7110/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7110\">Halo 2</a> was released later, though it still was in the top 5 played games. This also marks the 2nd time <a href=\"/ubisoft-entertainment/3010-82/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-82\">Ubisoft</a> had published the series as they published the expansion Black Thorn earlier.</p><h2>Change</h2><p>After the 3rd installment in the series Red Storm had changed the series with it's next out put: <i>LockDown.</i> The change was more than a mere update it graphical output, the entire gameplay of it's predecessors almost seemed scrapped. Rather than focus on slow pace tactical elements, the game was much like a standard FPS and was fast for the first time. The fans of the series and critics essentially panned the game for going too far out of it's original elements. One thing the series did introduce was the idea of creating a character whose stats could be affected by the type of armor they were wearing. The player could also gain experience points to unlock new guns, and armor. The next game was more of a expansion entitled <a href=\"/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-critical-hour/3030-11245/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11245\">R6 Critical Hour</a>, which was old missions from previous games, remade using the new gameplay of LockDown. This was also the last time Red Storm would develop for the series. The next game R6: Vegas was created for the first time on the \"next-gen\" consoles such as the <a href=\"/xbox-360/3045-20/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-20\">360</a>, and <a href=\"/playstation-3/3045-35/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-35\">PS3</a>. The gameplay was less action than LockDown and more than the original three, basically taking the best of both worlds in a way. The game introduced the new cover system that would go into a 3rd person mode but still keeping the sense of \"one shot one kill\" in mind with this slightly faster gameplay, much like <a href=\"/gears-of-war/3030-12231/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12231\">Gears of War</a>. Aside from gameplay the game focused more on plot this time through, and brought back the create a character feature from before. The gameplay was also more involved with it's guns, as you could decide what attachments you wanted to better suit your own play style such as <a href=\"/scope/3055-738/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-738\">scopes</a>, <a href=\"/stock/3055-2402/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2402\">stocks</a>, <a href=\"/magazine/3055-3143/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3143\">ammo clips</a>, <a href=\"/laser-sight/3055-1819/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1819\">laser sights</a>, silencers, etc. Fans who had been let down before had found a interest in the series again, even though it was not quite as tactical as the older games were, and so the game has been popular in reception and created a sequel R6: Vegas 2 which essentially more of the same thing.</p><h2>Future and Concerns</h2><p>Though, the <a href=\"/rainbow-six-vegas/3025-553/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-553\">Vegas</a> series has rebooted the series, older fans still criticize the gameplay, as it has become a little more focused on actions and mechanics similar to Gears of War than, the older tactical elements of the first few games. Some fans would argue that if they did go back to the old style gameplay of the original Rainbow Six games, that the game would feel dated or stale for today's tactical FPS's, others would argue that, the newer <a href=\"/ghost-recon/3025-557/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-557\">Ghost Recon series</a> or <a href=\"/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-advanced-warfighter/3030-2397/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2397\">GRAW (Ghost Recon Advanced War fighter)</a> is still similar to it's original tactical gameplay of the older games in it's multiplayer element while still being a good current tactical third person shooter. </p>", "guid": "3025-555", "name": "Rainbow Six"}, {"description": "<h2>Navigation</h2><p><b>Sub-franchises:</b></p><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"3025-555\" href=\"/rainbow-six/3025-555/\" slug=\"rainbow-six\">Rainbow Six</a></li></ul><div class=\"js-item-cage\">- <a data-ref-id=\"3025-553\" href=\"/rainbow-six-vegas/3025-553/\" slug=\"rainbow-six-vegas\">Rainbow Six: Vegas</a></div><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"3025-557\" href=\"/ghost-recon/3025-557/\" slug=\"ghost-recon\">Ghost Recon</a></li></ul><div class=\"js-item-cage\">- <a data-ref-id=\"3025-558\" href=\"/ghost-recon-advanced-warfighter/3025-558/\" slug=\"ghost-recon-advanced-warfighter\">Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter</a></div><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"3025-338\" href=\"/splinter-cell/3025-338/\" slug=\"splinter-cell\">Splinter Cell</a></li></ul><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"3025-1720\" href=\"/tom-clancys-hawx/3025-1720/\" slug=\"tom-clancys-hawx\">H.A.W.X</a></li></ul><h2>Overview</h2><p>Most people have either read a Tom Clancy novel or have seen a film adaptation. They're packed with international intrigue, military espionage, and usually some sort of nuclear device or rogue general on the loose. The Tom Clancy video game franchise began in 1990 with <a data-ref-id=\"3030-650\" href=\"/red-storm-rising/3030-650/\" slug=\"red-storm-rising\">Red Storm Rising</a>, followed by <a data-ref-id=\"3030-812\" href=\"/tom-clancys-ssn/3030-812/\" slug=\"tom-clancys-ssn\">SSN</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-4676\" href=\"/shadow-watch/3030-4676/\" slug=\"shadow-watch\">Shadow Watch</a>. While <a data-ref-id=\"3010-66\" href=\"/microprose-software-inc/3010-66/\" slug=\"microprose-software-inc\">MicroProse</a> produced Red Storm Rising, all games following that title were developed by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1498\" href=\"/red-storm-entertainment-inc/3010-1498/\" slug=\"red-storm-entertainment-inc\">Red Storm Entertainment</a>, a company Clancy co-founded in 1996. In 1998 the Tom Clancy franchise put its name on the map with a series that continues to be a hit.</p><p>All the Tom Clancy games take place in the same universe. Each IP tackles a different kind of warfare, from the stealth-based Sam Fisher, who sneaks in and takes out threats without anyone every knowing he was there, to the soldiers in Endwar, who are used in an open war. Some characters, like Ghost squad's Scott Mitchell is a general that will give you orders in Tom Clancy's Endwar.</p><h2>Rainbow Six</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/28/11002-Rainbow Six Cover.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-11002\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0\"><a  href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/28/11002-Rainbow Six Cover.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-11002\"><img alt=\"Rainbow Six Cover\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png w\" sizes=\"(max-width: px) 100vw, px\"></a><figcaption>Rainbow Six Cover</figcaption></figure><p>Developed and published by Red Storm Entertainment for the PC in 1998, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-7887\" href=\"/tom-clancys-rainbow-six/3030-7887/\" slug=\"tom-clancys-rainbow-six\">Rainbow Six</a> puts players in control of RAINBOW, an elite counter-terrorism force directed by John Clark and led by Ding Chavez.

After stopping the release of the Shiva virus, RAINBOW tracks down their one-time expert adviser John Brightling from Horizon Inc., a company using Phoenix Group as a front.

Just like in the original Rainbow Six, players plan out their strategy before starting their mission, assigning specific teams within RAINBOW to designated areas in order to neutralize \" tangos\" and either disarm bombs or save hostages. The player can switch between different teams and ops inside that team.

While the console and PC versions are slightly different in storyline (console versions are titled simply Rainbow Six 3 as well), the basic idea is that in the year 2005 RAINBOW has to stop an international terrorist organization backed by a South American presidential candidate. In the PC version, Nikola Gospic is a Nazi from the Ustashe regime in Croatia who fled following the fall of the Reich in 1945. With Holocaust loot, he finances Argentinian presidential candidate Alvero Guitierrez's campaign in return for political protection. His goal is to spread the VX nerve gas throughout the world by means of packaged meat and even attempts to attack the Festa Junina in Rio De Janeiro. Of course, all this is no match for team RAINBOW.</p><p><b>Expansions</b>:</p><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"3030-18600\" href=\"/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-3-athena-sword/3030-18600/\" slug=\"tom-clancys-rainbow-six-3-athena-sword\">Athena Sword</a> (2004): The year is 2007.

In this title, the organization is the Global Liberation Front, and the virus is the completely fatal \"Legion\" virus. Hopping around the globe to stop the GLF, and even rescuing one of their own (sniper Dieter Weber) from the hands of the terrorists, RAINBOW makes it clear that Bastian Vanderwaal and his GLF are no match for the covert ops.</p><p>In terms of gameplay, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-1581\" href=\"/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-lockdown/3030-1581/\" slug=\"tom-clancys-rainbow-six-lockdown\">Lockdown</a> was a distinct departure from the Rainbow Six series' emphasis on pre-mission planning, non-linear missions and realistic damage. Lockdown, in contrast, provided more of a run-n-gun feel, no pre-mission planning, and several shots to kill, or be killed by, a terrorist, rather than the previous one or two shots necessary. The PC version, released in 2006, made several changes in an attempt to return to the classic Rainbow Six formula that fans clearly wanted.</p><h3>Rainbow Six: Critical Hour (2006):</h3><p>An Xbox exclusive (a PS2 port was pursued though later scrapped), <a data-ref-id=\"3030-11245\" href=\"/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-critical-hour/3030-11245/\" slug=\"tom-clancys-rainbow-six-critical-hour\">this</a> title is seen by many as an attempt to curb criticism and return to the series' roots. <i>Critical Hour</i> provides gamers with non-linear, classic Rainbow Six gameplay with pre-mission tactical planning maps and realistic damage. In this title John Clark, RAINBOW's director, is retiring and passing the torch to Ding Chavez, Clark's son-in-law and leader of RAINBOW throughout all the previous games. John's nostalgia while cleaning out his office allows players to combat through seven missions, four from Rainbow Six, one from Rogue Spear, and one from Rogue Spear: Urban Operations.</p><h3>Rainbow Six: Vegas (2006):</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11911/557030-rainbow_six_vegas___ps3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-557030\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.153125\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:115.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11911/557030-rainbow_six_vegas___ps3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-557030\"><img alt=\"Rainbow Six: Vegas\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/11911/557030-rainbow_six_vegas___ps3.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/11911/557030-rainbow_six_vegas___ps3.jpg 640w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/11911/557030-rainbow_six_vegas___ps3.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Rainbow Six: Vegas\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/11911/557030-rainbow_six_vegas___ps3.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/11911/557030-rainbow_six_vegas___ps3.jpg 640w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/11911/557030-rainbow_six_vegas___ps3.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Rainbow Six: Vegas</figcaption></figure><p>In the year 2010, a new RAINBOW team is led by Logan Keller who, with his teammates Gabriel Nowak and Kan Akahashi, is charged with tracking down terrorist leader Irena Morales.

One of the game's most significant features was the save game <a href=\"/character-import/3015-970/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-970\">import</a> feature that carries over all the player decisions from the first game. The game starts as the Normandy is attacked by a <a href=\"../../the-collectors/92-4352/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Collector</a> vessel and torn to pieces. Shepard is spaced in the process and declared Killed In Action. The Commander's body is recovered by a fringe pro-human organization known as <a href=\"../../cerberus/92-3233/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Cerberus</a> and they spend two years restoring Shepard to the person he/she was.</p><p>After regaining consciousness, Shepard is given command of the new Normandy SR-2 and given a list of possible recruits for the fight against the Collectors. Instead of the Alliance or the <a href=\"/citadel-council/3015-1536/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1536\">Council</a>, Shepard now reports directly to <a href=\"../../the-illusive-man/94-10097/\" rel=\"nofollow \">The Illusive Man</a>, the head of the Cerberus network. They share a mutual goal of fighting the Reapers and they believe the Collectors to be the Reaper's agents. A majority of the story is character driven as Shepard spends most of the time gaining the new crew's loyalty. After assembling the team, Shepard leads them into a suicide mission inside the Collector home base. The earlier loyalty quests play an important part in the game's ending as it decides who survives the final suicide mission.</p><p>The combat in <i>Mass Effect 2</i> was given a major do-over and most of the RPG elements from the previous game were stripped down and streamlined. The weapon cache was lowered to just four weapons with an additional heavy weapon. Unlike the first game, the accuracy of a weapon was no longer affected by talents or class and the overheat mechanic was replaced by a more conventional reload system.

The game follows Commander Shepard's efforts to stop the Reaper invasion, which is in full swing at the beginning of the game. After narrowly escaping a devastating Reaper attack on Earth, Shepard sets out to build an army big enough to push back the Reapers. The structure is similar to that in <i>Mass Effect 2</i> in that Shepard must gain allies for his mission. However, the scale of the Reaper invasion means that Shepard must get entire races on his side rather than individual people. To do this, Shepard must deal with historic galactic issues, including the genophage, the relationship between the geth and the quarians, and more.</p><p>A new game mechanic is the concept of Galactic Readiness. This will affect the outcome of Shepard's efforts at the end of the game. Galactic Readiness is increased by completing side quests and gaining war assets. War assets feed into Military Strength, a number that shows the size of Shepard's army.</p><p>For the first time in the series, <i>Mass Effect 3</i> features online multiplayer in the form of a cooperative <a href=\"/horde/3015-3021/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3021\">Horde</a>-like mode. Up to four players battle against Reaper, Cerberus, Collector or geth forces across the galaxy. By completing matches (each one lasts 11 waves), the player will increase their Galactic Readiness in the single player. There are 6 maps and 3 difficulty levels. Each class from the single player is included in the multiplayer, and each class includes at least 4 characters from a variety of races to choose from. Each character has different abilities that can be improved when the player levels up.</p><p>New weapons, characters, supplies, and equipment are gained by spending credits on different packs that yield a randomized selection of items.</p><h2>Science &amp; Ships</h2><h3>Mass Effect Fields</h3><p>Like most works of science fiction, <i>Mass Effect</i> presents elaborate reasons behind its technology. The source of energy here are the Mass Effect Fields, that are generated by utilizing <a href=\"/element-zero/3055-3384/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3384\">element zero</a>.

They currently have the largest fleet in Citadel Space, and they proudly maintain their role of galactic peacekeepers in Citadel Space. In the past there has been hostility between humanity and the turians, due largely to the First Contact War, which is known to the turians as the Relay 314 Incident. The turians rely on the asari for solving diplomatic matters, and the salarians for their military intelligence, which creates an atmosphere where all three species lean on each other.

They quickly formed an alliance with the asari, and soon had a seat on the Citadel Council. Salarians are known as the best scientists and inventors of the universe, and are responsible for many great technological advancements. Salarians were able to transform the primitive, brutal, krogans into some of the most feared mercenaries in the universe, though only years later they would turn around and develop the genophage virus that would nearly wipe out the entire krogan population. Salarians do not live very long, with an average life span of only forty years. This short lifespan is due to their hyperactive metabolism. This fast moving metabolism is what allows the salarians to move, think, and talk at a much faster pace than other species.</td></tr><tr><td><h3><b>Humans</b></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1037001\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/1037001-290px_council_chambers_udina_anderson.png\" data-ratio=\"0.5551724137931\" data-width=\"290\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 290px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/1037001-290px_council_chambers_udina_anderson.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1037001\"><img alt=\"Humans, the latest species to discover the Citadel\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 290px) 100vw, 290px\" data-width=\"290\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/3/39996/1037001-290px_council_chambers_udina_anderson.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/3/39996/1037001-290px_council_chambers_udina_anderson.png 290w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Humans, the latest species to discover the Citadel\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/3/39996/1037001-290px_council_chambers_udina_anderson.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/3/39996/1037001-290px_council_chambers_udina_anderson.png 290w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 290px) 100vw, 290px\" data-width=\"290\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Humans, the latest species to discover the Citadel</figcaption></figure> Main Article: <a href=\"http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Human\" rel=\"nofollow \">Humans</a><br />In the <i>Mass Effect</i> fiction, humans are biologically the same as the present. However, they have developed the ability for long distance space travel after the discovery of the <a href=\"/mass-relay/3055-1181/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1181\">Mass Relay</a> near Pluto. Humans are also capable <a href=\"/\">biotics</a> and use special implants to enhance their inherent biotic abilities in combat.<br />The Human Mass Relay endeavour kick-started after they discovered an old <a href=\"/protheans/3015-1751/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1751\">Prothean</a> cache on Mars in 2148. Their first steps into the council space were marked with a war against the turians - known as the First Contact War. The conflict started as a result of human attempts to activate the Pluto Mass Relay, which was deemed illegal under Council laws. After the Council became aware of the conflict, they wasted no time in negotiating a peace treaty and incorporating the humans into Citadel space.<br />Since then, humans have rapidly progressed to the point of gaining a seat on the Council by the end of the first game, a mere twenty-four years after the First Contact War, and humanity's emergence into <a href=\"/citadel-space/3035-2733/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2733\">Citadel Space</a>. The human representative on the council depends on the player's choice. The two options presented are <a href=\"../../donnel-udina/94-2929/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Udina</a> and <a href=\"../../captain-david-anderson/94-3123/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Anderson</a>. Due to their initial conflict, as well as humanity's rapid expansion, the Humans and the rest of the council races have never been able to trust each other completely, in spite of working together on the council. Depending on the player actions, these council relations can either improve or deteriorate further with time.<br />Humanity's history in the <i>Mass Effect</i> universe between the present and the discovery of the Mass Relays is left ambiguous and characters instead allude to classical works for references; for example Ashley Williams quotes a Tennyson poem during a conversation with Shepard. And a Drill Sergeant. in <i>Mass Effect 2</i> refers to Sir Isaac Newton as \"the deadliest-son-of-a-bitch in space\".</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Non-Council Races</h2><p>Most of the non-council races still live in Citadel Space and follow Citadel laws. But there is still a general unrest among many of them about the Citadel's rule and some of these races are actively at war against each other. There are also species that live completely outside the council space and follow their own rules.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><h3><b>Krogan</b></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-360864\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/360864-krogan2.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.9024\" data-width=\"625\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 625px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:90.2%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/360864-krogan2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-360864\"><img alt=\"Wrex, a Krogan Battlemaster\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/1138/360864-krogan2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/1138/360864-krogan2.jpg 625w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/1138/360864-krogan2.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/1138/360864-krogan2.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Wrex, a Krogan Battlemaster\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/1138/360864-krogan2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/1138/360864-krogan2.jpg 625w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/1138/360864-krogan2.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/1138/360864-krogan2.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Wrex, a Krogan Battlemaster</figcaption></figure> Main Article: <a href=\"../../krogan/92-579/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Krogan</a><br />The krogan are native to the planet Tuchanka. After they almost destroyed their homeworld in a vicious nuclear war, the krogan were forced to evolve to live in the eternal nuclear winter that had engulfed their world. Because of this forced evolution, krogan are impervious to toxins, radiation, and extreme temperature. They also store water and nutrients much like a camel in the hump on their back. Their skin is as thick as iron, so bullets and explosions do minimal damage. They also have multiples of major organs, just in case one gets damaged. These qualities make krogan extremely hard to kill, which makes them extremely well suited for combat and are frequently employed as mercenaries and bounty hunters. Krogan also reproduce and mature at a rapid pace in order to keep their population steady.<br />The krogan were severely affected by the <a href=\"/genophage/3015-5565/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5565\">genophage</a>, a biological weapon engineered by the salarians and used by the turians to quell the Krogan Rebellions after the krogan had ended the centuries long Rachni Wars. The genophage makes it so that only 1 in a 1,000 krogan births are successful. Thus, the krogan are a dwindling species.</td></tr><tr><td><h3><b>Quarian</b></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1258281\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/1258281-tali_zorah_nar_rayya_mass_effect_2_screenshot_character.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.13125\" data-width=\"800\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:113.1%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/1258281-tali_zorah_nar_rayya_mass_effect_2_screenshot_character.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1258281\"><img alt=\"Tali, a Quarian Tech Specialist\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 565px) 100vw, 565px\" data-width=\"565\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/32621/1258281-tali_zorah_nar_rayya_mass_effect_2_screenshot_character.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/3/32621/1258281-tali_zorah_nar_rayya_mass_effect_2_screenshot_character.jpg 800w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/3/32621/1258281-tali_zorah_nar_rayya_mass_effect_2_screenshot_character.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/32621/1258281-tali_zorah_nar_rayya_mass_effect_2_screenshot_character.jpg 565w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Tali, a Quarian Tech Specialist\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/32621/1258281-tali_zorah_nar_rayya_mass_effect_2_screenshot_character.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/3/32621/1258281-tali_zorah_nar_rayya_mass_effect_2_screenshot_character.jpg 800w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/3/32621/1258281-tali_zorah_nar_rayya_mass_effect_2_screenshot_character.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/32621/1258281-tali_zorah_nar_rayya_mass_effect_2_screenshot_character.jpg 565w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 565px) 100vw, 565px\" data-width=\"565\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Tali, a Quarian Tech Specialist</figcaption></figure> Main Article: <a href=\"../../quarian/92-825/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Quarian</a><br />The quarians are a race with no planet to call home, thanks primarily to their own hubris and a race of sentient machines known as the geth.<br />The quarians travel in what is called the <a href=\"/migrant-fleet/3035-2753/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2753\">Flotilla</a>, a massive fleet of over fifty thousand space ships that is home to over 17 million quarians. To prevent overcrowding and to add resources to the Flotilla's always dangerously low stores, every young quarian must go on a rite of passage called the Pilgrimage. After leaving on the Pilgrimage, a quarian is not allowed to return until they bring something useful back to the Flotilla. Other species tend to look down on the quarians because of the Flotilla, because when it arrives in a system it has a largely negative impact on the local populace. The large number of ships in the Flotilla clog space traffic and the quarians need for resources often forces them to strip local asteroid belts of their valuable metals. Since the quarians have been living in a sterile atmosphere within the Flotilla, their immune system has become practically non-existent. For this reason any quarian traveling away from the Flotilla carries a form-fitting vital suit to filter the air, keeping them safe from illnesses that would otherwise kill them. Quarians rarely leave the Flotilla though, unless it is to go on their pilgramage or because they have been exiled for committing some form of unforgivable crime like rape or slave dealing. Because of quarians' nomadic nature and their ability to re-use and repair things long beyond the point where any other race would've scrapped them, most of the galaxy reviews them as scavengers, or even thieves, and quarians are often met with prejudice and hostility.</td></tr><tr><td><h3><b>Volus</b></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1253953\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/1253953-volus_codex_image.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.0147928994083\" data-width=\"338\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 338px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:101.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/1253953-volus_codex_image.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1253953\"><img alt=\"The timid Volus\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" data-width=\"630\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/14070/1253953-volus_codex_image.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/14070/1253953-volus_codex_image.jpg 338w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The timid Volus\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/14070/1253953-volus_codex_image.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/14070/1253953-volus_codex_image.jpg 338w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" data-width=\"630\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The timid Volus</figcaption></figure> Main Article: <a href=\"../../volus/92-1305/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Volus</a><br />The volus are the businessmen of the <i>Mass Effect</i> universe. They are not very physically capable but have a knack for trade. Volus frequently hire krogans and turians as their bodyguards. While the volus are an independent species they are also clients of turians who act as their military force. The volus homeworld, Irune, has a high-pressure greenhouse atmosphere, resulting in volus needing to wear pressure suits and breathers when interacting with other species. The volus were the third species to arrive on the Citadel, after the asari and salarians, however they have never managed to gain a seat on the Council, leaving many volus bitter, and creating a particular resentment towards humans for their rapid ascension on the Citadel. This is particularly exemplified by volus ambassador Din Korlack.</td></tr><tr><td><h3><b>Batarian</b></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-424756\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/424756-batarian1.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/424756-batarian1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-424756\"><img alt=\"Batarian Mercenaries\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/6742/424756-batarian1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/6742/424756-batarian1.jpg 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/0/6742/424756-batarian1.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/6742/424756-batarian1.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/6742/424756-batarian1.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Batarian Mercenaries\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/6742/424756-batarian1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/6742/424756-batarian1.jpg 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/0/6742/424756-batarian1.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/6742/424756-batarian1.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/6742/424756-batarian1.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Batarian Mercenaries</figcaption></figure> Main Article: <a href=\"../../batarian/92-1393/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Batarian</a><br />The batarians are generally seen as humanoids with four eyes and a bad attitude.

When it was clear humanity had the upper hand and that the Council was not going to intervene in batarian favor, the batarians severed all ties with the galactic community. Thus began a period of self imposed exile, with the exception of well funded pirate raids on human colonies. Batarians who remain in the Terminus Systems are often slavers, pirates, and smugglers. However, the typical batarian is not so vile.

The codex includes descriptions for everything from alien races to planets to the different technologies. Most, if not all, of the codex entries are grounded in some form of reality, or what could be perceived as potential reality. For example, part of the codex entry for Mass Effect Fields reads, \"Element zero can increase or decrease the mass of volume of space-time when subjected to an electrical current. With a positive current, mass is increased. With a negative current, mass is decreased. The stronger the current, the greater the magnitude of the dark energy mass effect.\"</td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><td><h2><b>Novels</b></h2><h3><b><i>Mass Effect: Revelation</i></b></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-943622\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7473/943622-masseffect_revelation.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.6447368421053\" data-width=\"304\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 304px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:164.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7473/943622-masseffect_revelation.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-943622\"><img alt=\"Revelation\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 304px) 100vw, 304px\" data-width=\"304\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7473/943622-masseffect_revelation.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7473/943622-masseffect_revelation.jpg 304w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Revelation\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7473/943622-masseffect_revelation.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7473/943622-masseffect_revelation.jpg 304w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 304px) 100vw, 304px\" data-width=\"304\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Revelation</figcaption></figure> The first novel written about the <i>Mass Effect</i> universe, by Canadian author <a href=\"/drew-karpyshyn/3040-29919/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-29919\">Drew Karpyshyn</a>, this story fills in much of the background information left unexplained by the game, such as the backgrounds of the Saren Arterius and David Anderson.

Similarly to the first novel Shepard doesn't appear in the story (other than passing mentions to the events of the first game). It is set roughly two months after the events of the first <i>Mass Effect</i> game and great care is taken so as to not to mention major plot details from the first game. The quarians are also a major topic in this game and as such, their culture and history is explored in great detail.<br />The narrative is primarily split between Cerberus agent Paul Grayson, and Kahlee Sanders who is on the Ascension Project board of directors. Grayson is the adopted father of a twelve-year-old autistic girl, named Gillian, who has extraordinary <a href=\"/biotics/3015-4299/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4299\">biotic</a> potential, which caused Cerberus to have strong interest in her and invest a great deal in researching and developing her biotic abilities, and is the reason they gave Paul the task of raising her.<br />Gillian is a student at the Jon Grissom Academy, a school for gifted children, specifically she is part of the Ascension Project, a joint civilian/ <a href=\"/systems-alliance/3015-6245/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6245\">Alliance</a> program to research biotic abilities, and help young biotics learn to develop and control their abilities. When a Cerberus scientist, who had infiltrated the project to perform tests on Gillian, blows his cover Paul is directed to pull Gillian out of Ascension, before his cover is also blown. Due to their attachment to Gillian, Kahlee Sanders and Ascension's chief of security, Hendel Mitra, decide to accompany Gillian arguing that their former Alliance military skills will be essential in protecting the girl from Cerberus.<br />Grayson plans to travel to <a href=\"/omega/3035-2749/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2749\">Omega</a> to meet with his former Cerberus partner, Pel, and his team of mercenaries, and get rid of Kahlee and Hendel so he can take Gillian back to Cerberus. When they arrive on Omega Pel reveals that he has betrayed Cerberus and is planning to sell the bitoics, Gillian and Hendel, to the Collectors, and will throw the other two in to sweeten the deal. Pel and his team lock Gillian, Paul, Hendel and Kahlee up in their hideout, but not before revealing that Paul is a Cerberus agent, meaning he has to be locked in a separate room to the other three to protect him from the for The Collectors.<br />Lemm'Shal nar Tesleya (Lemm), a young quarian on his pilgrimage, has tracked a missing Quarian team to Omega and to Pel. Lemm breaks into Pel's hideout expecting to find the missing quarians, but instead finds Kahlee along with Hendel and Gillian; Lemm helps them escape, leaving Grayson under Kahlee's instruction and they flee seeking asylum from <a href=\"/migrant-fleet/3035-2753/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2753\">The Migrant Fleet</a>. Lemm reveals that he did not help Kahlee purely out of the kindness of his heart: He recognised her; the quarians believed Kahlee to have knowledge regarding the geth that they may be able to use, since she had a history with <a href=\"/artificial-intelligence/3015-218/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-218\">AI</a>s from her previous career as an Alliance technology researcher, and her link with Saren Arterius through both their involvement in the story of <i>Mass Effect: Revelation</i>. After speaking with Kahlee the quarians come to the conclusion that it is likely that <a href=\"/sovereign/3005-1811/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1811\">Sovereign</a> was some form of alien technology which Saren used to control the geth.<br />In the commotion caused by Lemm's assault on Pel's hideout Grayson manages to escape, but Gillian has been taken off Omega before he can catch up with her. He informs the <a href=\"/the-illusive-man/3005-10097/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-10097\">Illusive Man</a> that Gillian has been taken and his cover blown; he also tells The Illusive Man that he believes she is on the Quarian Flotilla, as he found a quarian weapon in Pel's hideout (along with other circumstantial evidence). Grayson leads a Cerberus assault team to retrieve his daughter leading to a bloody battle between Cerberus and the quarians, during which Gillian's biotic potential truly begins to emerge. Although Grayson does retrieve his daughter he ultimately decides that she is better off with Hendel than she ever was with him and agrees to let her stay with him and go on the first quarian exploration into uncharted territories to search for a new quarian homeworld.</td></tr><tr><td><h3><i>Mass Effect: Retribution</i></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1477155\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/80178/1477155-mass_effect_retribution_novel_3_artwork_prequel_mass_effect_2.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.641935483871\" data-width=\"310\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:164.2%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/80178/1477155-mass_effect_retribution_novel_3_artwork_prequel_mass_effect_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1477155\"><img alt=\"Retribution\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 310px) 100vw, 310px\" data-width=\"310\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/8/80178/1477155-mass_effect_retribution_novel_3_artwork_prequel_mass_effect_2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/8/80178/1477155-mass_effect_retribution_novel_3_artwork_prequel_mass_effect_2.jpg 310w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Retribution\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/8/80178/1477155-mass_effect_retribution_novel_3_artwork_prequel_mass_effect_2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/8/80178/1477155-mass_effect_retribution_novel_3_artwork_prequel_mass_effect_2.jpg 310w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 310px) 100vw, 310px\" data-width=\"310\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Retribution</figcaption></figure> The third title in the book series once again written by Drew Karpyshyn.

It is characterized by wild tricks, big drops, and crazy characters.</p><p>The first game in the series, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-1932\" href=\"/ssx/3030-1932/\" slug=\"ssx\">SSX</a>, was a <a data-ref-id=\"3045-19\" href=\"/playstation-2/3045-19/\" slug=\"playstation-2\">Playstation 2</a> launch title that was valued as one of the best. Its blend of fast downhill racing and mind-bending tricks captivated the public, and so a sequel was quickly made. SSX Tricky was the first in the series to reach multiple consoles, coming to both the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-32\" href=\"/xbox/3045-32/\" slug=\"xbox\">Xbox</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3045-23\" href=\"/gamecube/3045-23/\" slug=\"gamecube\">Gamecube</a> as well as the stalwart PS2. <a data-ref-id=\"3030-18782\" href=\"/ssx-tricky/3030-18782/\" slug=\"ssx-tricky\">SSX Tricky</a>, ironically, introduced few tricks, with the only new content being two new courses, \"Uber Tricks,\" and a rivalry system. It was still widely praised, however, thanks to its outstanding quality.</p><p>Then came <a data-ref-id=\"3030-17149\" href=\"/ssx-3/3030-17149/\" slug=\"ssx-3\">SSX 3</a>, the greatest departure - and advancement - of the formula. SSX 3 included an entire mountain to race down that connected the various structured courses. With three peaks and individual courses therein, it was the largest and most universally praised SSX to date.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4/9651-game-ssx 3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-9651\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0\"><a  href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4/9651-game-ssx 3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-9651\"><img alt=\"SSX 3\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png w\" sizes=\"(max-width: px) 100vw, px\"></a><figcaption>SSX 3</figcaption></figure><p>After SSX 3, the formula seemed to be set in stone. But then came <a data-ref-id=\"3030-12418\" href=\"/ssx-on-tour/3030-12418/\" slug=\"ssx-on-tour\">SSX On Tour</a>, a strange and not entirely successful regression to the formula set down in the first two SSXs. The most apparent initial difference was the style: while SSX had always been \"zany,\" On Tour took it to the next level with a sketch-book aesthetic and a \"Street\" style. Next came the biggest shock of all: the game had no online mode to speak of, like its predecessor. Then came the introduction of Skis, which offered little difference from snowboards other than a marginally different trick set. It also introduce a custom character creator. While series mainstays were no longer available for the main campaign they still made appearances in the free ride and multiplayer modes. While not as warmly received by critics it still kept an 81 out of 100 on Metacritic.</p><p>After a two year hiatus came <a data-ref-id=\"3030-17969\" href=\"/ssx-blur/3030-17969/\" slug=\"ssx-blur\">SSX Blur</a>, a Wii game that used the motion controls to perform tricks and offered little in the way of new content, instead recycling old courses and eliminating the open world aspect of the previous two games. While currently possesing the lowest Metacritic rating of any game in the series it was still received with general warmth.</p><p>After Blur the series dropped off the map, much to the disappointment of fans. At the Spike 2011 VGA's, however, a trailer for what is assumed to be a series reboot (due to its title being simply <a data-ref-id=\"3030-33393\" href=\"/ssx/3030-33393/\" slug=\"ssx\">SSX</a>) was shown with the new game coming to PS3 and 360. The initial trailer was not well received by fans who felt it betrayed the over-the-top nature the series was known for in an effort to garner the attention of those who liked \"gritty\" games. The marketing campaign has since been overhauled significantly in an attempt to ensure fans that this is the SSX they know and love.</p>", "guid": "3025-564", "name": "SSX"}, {"description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Gears of War follows the exploits of <a href=\"/marcus-fenix/3005-180/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-180\">Marcus Fenix</a> as he tries to save mankind from the <a href=\"/locust-horde/3015-454/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-454\">Locust Horde</a>.

He is capable of fixing vehicles and building a giant bomb.

She provides vital intel to the squad and updates as their mission progresses. In Gears of War 3, Anya joins the fight with Marcus and the others and she is also a playable character in multiplayer.</p><h3>New Trilogy</h3><h3><a href=\"/jd-fenix/3005-31976/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-31976\">JD Fenix</a></h3><p>The son of Marcus Fenix, JD went AWOL from the COG with his friend Del Walker and joined up with a group of Outsiders, citizens who live outside of COG rule.</p><h3><a href=\"/kait-diaz/3005-31977/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-31977\">Kait Diaz</a></h3><p>One of JD's best friends and an Outsider, Kait is heavily devoted to her family.

He gives orders to Marcus' squad throughout both games.</p><h3><a href=\"/jack/3005-5220/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5220\">Jack</a></h3><p>Jack is a flying robot capable of turning itself invisible so it doesn't get shot during fights. Whenever Delta Squad needs to open a door that they can't kick open, they call on Jack for assistance. In Gears 2, Jack was outfitted with a small screen that Anya could use to talk to Delta.</p><h2>Games</h2><h3><a href=\"/gears-of-war/3030-12231/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12231\">Gears of War</a></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/87790/1970470-box_gow.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1970470\" data-ratio=\"1.20625\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:120.6%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/87790/1970470-box_gow.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1970470\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/1970470-box_gow.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/8/87790/1970470-box_gow.png 640w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/1970470-box_gow.png 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/1970470-box_gow.png 530w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 530px) 100vw, 530px\" data-width=\"530\"></a></figure><p><b>Release Date:</b> November 7, 2006</p><p>The first game in the series helped to popularize third person cover-based gameplay.

The story is about Marcus' attempt to find his father, who reveals himself to be a alive in a recorded message. His father, Adam Fenix, claims to have developed a weapon that will completely eradicate the Lambent threat and possibly save the dying planet. The campaign can be played cooperatively and an Arcade mode has been added that allows players to play through the entire campaign with scoring.</p><p>Gears of War 3 greatly expanded the series' multiplayer component. The competitive multiplayer remains and has some new features, including the ability to select different starting weapons before a match and after a death as well as the ability to put custom skins on weapons. Horde mode returns and has a significant tower defense feel to it. Players now earn money from assists and kills which they can spend on fortifications like barriers, decoys, turrets, and more. All of the fortifications can be upgraded by spending money on them. The upgrades either reduce the cost of repairs or allow the player to construct better versions of the fortification. For example, the level 1 barrier is a set of <a href=\"/makibishi/3055-687/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-687\">caltrops</a> but can be upgraded into razor wire or lasers.</p><p>A new addition is Beast mode, which is essentially Horde in reverse. Players take control of a variety of Locust forces, including Boomers, mini Corpsers, and Tickers, and must defeat increasingly large groups of Stranded and COG forces who have barricaded themselves behind fortifications. There are 12 waves and players unlock additional tiers of Locust as they progress through the match, eventually getting the ability to play as a Berserker (although it costs over $5000 to do so).</p><h3><a href=\"/gears-of-war-4/3030-45269/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-45269\">Gears of War 4</a></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3699/2892487-gears%20of%20war%204%20v1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2892487\" data-ratio=\"1.2727272727273\" data-width=\"825\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 825px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:127.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3699/2892487-gears%20of%20war%204%20v1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2892487\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 502px) 100vw, 502px\" data-width=\"502\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/3699/2892487-gears%20of%20war%204%20v1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/3699/2892487-gears%20of%20war%204%20v1.jpg 825w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/3699/2892487-gears%20of%20war%204%20v1.jpg 754w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/3699/2892487-gears%20of%20war%204%20v1.jpg 502w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/3699/2892487-gears%20of%20war%204%20v1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/3699/2892487-gears%20of%20war%204%20v1.jpg 825w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/3699/2892487-gears%20of%20war%204%20v1.jpg 754w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/3699/2892487-gears%20of%20war%204%20v1.jpg 502w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 502px) 100vw, 502px\" data-width=\"502\"></noscript></a></figure><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>October 11, 2016</p><p>Gears of War 4 is the first mainline game in the series to be developed by The Coalition and the first mainline entry for the Xbox One.

New Line Cinema announced that Stuart Beattie, Marty Bowen, and Wyck Godfrey would be writing the film, while Godfrey will also be producing the film. The film was also announced for a 2009 release, though it was soon delayed to 2010 with the filming beginning in 2009. Gears of War creator <a href=\"/cliff-bleszinski/3040-9856/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-9856\">Cliff Bleszinski</a> announced he would be serving as the executive producer for the film. A few months later, Live Free or Die Hard director Len Wiseman, known for \"Live Free or Die Hard and \"Underworld,\" was announced as the director of the film. The film was rumored to be a prequel to the first game.</p><p>On Dec. 17, 2010, Mike Capps revealed that Len Wiseman was no longer attached to the project but the movie was still in preproduction.</p><p>The purported Gears of War movie was again confirmed to be in development at Universal in October 2016.

The series was originally created by <a href=\"/martin-edmonson/3040-84776/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-84776\">Martin Edmonson</a> as an homage to car chase movies from the 1970s.</p><p>Each game has emphasis on car pursuits in an open world city setting.</p><h2>Main Games</h2><h3><strong><a href=\"/driver/3030-7020/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7020\">Driver</a> (1999)</strong></h3><p>The first in the series, it was released in 1999 on the original PlayStation, and then on the PC and Macintosh in 2000. The game put the player in the role of <a href=\"/tanner/3005-10862/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-10862\">Tanner</a>, an undercover detective working as a wheelman. It established the series' cinematic driving inspired by classic car chase movies like Bullitt and was met with critical acclaim.</p><h3><strong><a href=\"/driver-2-the-wheelman-is-back/3030-10953/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10953\">Driver 2: The Wheelman is Back</a> (2000)</strong></h3><p>Also known as 'Driver 2: Back on the Streets' in Europe, it once again featured Tanner and introduced his new partner <a href=\"/tobias-jones/3005-10883/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-10883\">Tobias Jones</a>. The game focused more on the narrative this time, with a structured story (Tanner and Jones are after a man named <a href=\"/solomon-caine/3005-10949/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-10949\">Solomon Caine</a>) and pre-rendered cut scenes played between various missions. A first for the series was the ability to exit the car, walk around on foot, and then 'steal' a different vehicle. There was a mixed reaction from fans and critics, and it was never released on PC or other consoles.</p><h3><strong><a href=\"/driv3r/3030-14491/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14491\">Driv3r</a> (2004)</strong></h3><p>With a new generation of hardware, Reflections returned once again with Driv3r/Driver 3, going for a cinematic theme even more, with voice talent from big Hollywood names such as <a href=\"/michael-madsen/3040-51156/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-51156\">Michael Madsen</a> (as Tanner) and <a href=\"/ving-rhames/3040-98110/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-98110\">Ving Rhames</a> (as Tobias Jones). The 1970s look was abandoned for a more modern day appearance, with both classic and modern cars on the streets, as well as the addition of boats and motorcycles. The game also featured third person shootouts, one of the many reasons the game was poorly received by most critics and fans.</p><h3><strong><a href=\"/driver-parallel-lines/3030-17604/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17604\">Driver: Parallel Lines</a> (2006)</strong></h3><p>The first game to abandon Tanner and company, Parallel Lines featured a new protagonist known as The Kid/TK, a getaway driver hired by various criminals. Also, unlike the previous games which featured three to four cities each, the whole game was set in New York City, and takes place across two time periods: 1978 and 2006. Not much else was changed: the game still had a story campaign that focused on high speed chases, as well as third person shooting.</p><h3><strong><a href=\"/driver-san-francisco/3030-31634/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-31634\">Driver: San Francisco</a> (2011)</strong></h3><p>After a seven year absence, <a href=\"/tanner/3005-10862/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-10862\">Tanner</a> made his triumphant return in the latest Driver game. Set entirely in San Francisco, one of the cities featured in the first game, Tanner and his partner Tobias Jones are out to get Jericho, who was first introduced in Driver 2. The developers have emphasized a return to the roots of the series, removing all on foot interactions and keeping the action exclusively behind the wheel.</p><h2>Spin-Offs</h2><h3><strong><a href=\"/driver-76/3030-4486/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4486\">Driver '76</a> (2007)</strong></h3><p>A spin-off prequel of the previous game, this was a PSP-only title featuring a different character from Parallel Lines, 'Ray'. Co-developed with <a href=\"/sumo-digital-ltd/3010-3954/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-3954\">Sumo Digital</a>.</p><h3><strong><a href=\"/driver-renegade/3030-31782/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-31782\">Driver: Renegade</a> (2011)</strong></h3><p>Renegade is a 3DS game which features Tanner taking down criminals in New York City. Released at the same time as the console title, but with a number of peculiar differences, the 3DS game has a more serious and mature tone compared to Driver SF's light-hearted story, and where D:SF only had a Teen rating, Renegade received a Mature rating.</p><h2>Successors</h2><p>There are also <a href=\"/game-boy-color/3045-57/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-57\">Game Boy Color</a> versions of Driver 1 &amp; 2, and a <a href=\"/game-boy-advance/3045-4/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-4\">Game Boy Advance</a> version of Driv3r and a few mobile phone games made under license by <a href=\"/gameloft-sa/3010-743/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-743\">Gameloft</a>, one of which is an iPhone version of the first Driver.</p><p><a href=\"/cop-the-recruit/3030-26835/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-26835\">C.O.P The Recruit</a>, a Ubisoft game on the Nintendo DS that featured similar gameplay to some Driver games, had at one point the working title 'Driver - The Recruit'.</p><p>Originally, <a href=\"/watch-dogs/3030-38538/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-38538\">Watch Dogs</a> was developed as a game in the Driver series with emphasis on hacking to avoid car pursuits. The driving mechanics of the Watch Dogs series is primarily developed by <a href=\"/ubisoft-reflections/3010-921/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-921\">Ubisoft Reflections</a>.</p><h2>Legacy</h2><p>A competitor to the <em>Driver series </em>was Grand Theft Auto. Due to this competition, there have been several references to each game by both parties.</p><p>In <a href=\"/grand-theft-auto-iii/3030-3724/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3724\">GTA III</a>, one of the side missions given in the game was to kill an undercover cop named Tanner. To add insult to injury, he was given a walking animation used for female characters in the game, referring to criticism of Tanner 'running like a girl' in Driver 2. Reflections responded to this by featuring a character in Driv3r named Timmy Vermicelli who constantly wore arm floats, a jab at how <a href=\"/tommy-vercetti/3005-14/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14\">Tommy Vercetti</a> in <a href=\"/grand-theft-auto-vice-city/3030-17036/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17036\">GTA: Vice City</a> was unable to swim; falling into water in the game resulted in him drowning.</p><p>Rockstar responded to this in <a href=\"/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas/3030-7120/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7120\">GTA: San Andreas</a>. In a mission where the player has to sneak into Madd Dogg's mansion, he is playing a video game on the TV while yelling: \"Damn, I mean how can Refractions mess up so bad? Tanner, you suck ass!\", most likely referring to how poorly received Driv3r was. There was also a graveyard with gravestones that read \"RIP Opposition 1997-2004\".</p><h2>Trivia</h2><ul><li>There is a not-so-subtle reference to Driver: San Francisco featured in <a href=\"/watch-dogs-2/3030-54066/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-54066\">Watch Dogs 2</a>.</li></ul>", "guid": "3025-566", "name": "Driver"}, {"description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>The Rock Band franchise is a series of rhythm games that simulate a full band experience, with guitar, bass, drums, and vocals, with a keyboard peripheral also added for Rock Band 3.

To date all of the Sailor Moon video games have been based on the anime version.</p><p>Sailor Moon was first released overseas in 1995, starting with the anime and most of the Dark Kingdom arc. This was followed by a filler arc set between the first two arc and half of the Black Moon arc. In 1997 Tokyopop gained the license for the Sailor Moon manga, and almost single-handedly created a market for manga in North America with it. After DiC lost the anime license it was picked up by Cloverway who released the Infinity arc in 2000. The Dream Arc was later released to DVD, and to date the Sailor Stars anime arc has never been officially released outside of Japan.</p><h2>Legacy</h2><p>Sailor Moon stage plays continued in Japan from 1993 through 2005, with multiple productions each year. In 2003 an updated release of the manga was created to coincide with a 52 episode live-action adaptation of the Dark Kingdom arc.

The game franchise is overlooked by Rare, and published by Microsoft Game Studios for the Xbox 360 and Games for Windows, and THQ for the Nintendo DS.</p> <h3>Viva Pi\u00f1ata</h3> <p class=\"MsoNormal\">Originally developed for the Xbox 360, and also later released under the Games for Windows brand, Viva Pi\u00f1ata is a simulation of a Pi\u00f1ata farm. The player has control of a garden and can plant trees or plants, attract wild Pi\u00f1ata, romance tamed Pi\u00f1ata and fulfil requests from Pi\u00f1ata Central. The game includes a RPG-style levelling system, in which the player gains experience for filling the Pi\u00f1ata Central records book - containing information of Pi\u00f1atas and plants. The game has no mission structure and is entirely open-ended, leaving the player to play at their own pace.</p> <h3>Party Animals</h3> <p class=\"MsoNormal\">The second game in the franchise veered away from its past, instead taking the form of a mini-game collection. The game plays out a Pi\u00f1ata competition - in which Pi\u00f1atas are chosen to participate in races and challenge events. Challenge events include eating apples, painting floors, squashing ants and hitting Professor Pester - all in the aim of gaining the most candy. It was the first game in the series to have online play, and allowed 4 people to play against each other in competition.</p> <h3>Pocket Paradise</h3> <p class=\"MsoNormal\">Developed for the DS, Pocket Paradise is a re-imagining of the original Viva Pi\u00f1ata. It contains a very similar structure, but a very different leveling system. As well as this, Rare fine tuned many aspects of the game for use on the DS. The romance dance mini-games were removed, plant fertilizer and romance candy became harder to acquire, and shopkeepers have harder requests (often requiring more than chocolate coins). Pocket Paradise introduces 7 new Pi\u00f1ata to the franchise, which can also be found in Trouble in Paradise. </p> <h3>Trouble in Paradise</h3> <p class=\"MsoNormal\">The first true sequel to the original game, Trouble in Paradise allows 4-player co-op and introduces 30 new Pi\u00f1ata to the mix, as well as 2 new locations - a desert and arctic area. The game also has Live Vision camera support, allowing the player to scan in Pi\u00f1ata cards and the Pi\u00f1ata will appear in their garden, making swapping Pi\u00f1ata between people easier. In the storyline, Professor Pester has stolen the Pi\u00f1ata Central records, and they require you to build them back up by rebuilding the database just like the original game.</p>", "guid": "3025-586", "name": "Viva Pi\u00f1ata"}, {"description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Originating as a series of games during the 16-bit era on the <a href=\"/genesis/3045-6/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-6\">Genesis</a>, the Ecco franchise centered around the concept that underwater mammals are sentient.

In the beginning Chell wakes from a Stasis cell to GLaDOS, and is moved along through the tests with the promise of freedom and escape. At the end of the tests as she is about to be incinerated she jumps into a nearby repair duct and escapes from the test and now the next part of the game is spent going throughout the complex in an attempt to escape. At the end of the game Chell incinerate GLaDOS as she references the chaos going on outside of the complex (supposedly the events of <a href=\"/half-life-2/3030-1539/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1539\">Half-Life 2</a>) and once the game is over the song Still Alive plays and shows a room with the <a href=\"/weighted-companion-cube/3005-22/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-22\">Companion Cube</a> and <a href=\"/cake/3055-56/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-56\">cake</a>.

Chell is still in Aperture and she still wishes to escape. GLaDOS rises from the dead while new characters are introduced such as the Personality Sphere Wheatley and Aperture's founder Cave Johnson. The first act of the game reprises the same concept as the first with Chell having to pass all of GLaDOS' tests while the second act has GLaDOS and Chell teaming up against Wheatley who has taken control of the facility.

Within the backstory Arpeture Science is a long time rival of Black Mesa's and both are competing to get a portal device to market. (The failure of Black Mesa to do this successfully leads to the events of Half Life 1) This is never explicitly made clear within the game apart from a few references to Black Mesa. In the final battle of Portal, however Glados mentions various activities going on outside since Chell's imprisonment that she can not make sense of. In addition during the ending song Glados tells Chell \"Maybe you'll find someone else  to help you/  Maybe Black Mesa/That was a joke/ha ha  Fat Chance\" It is believed by most fans that these cryptic clues refers to the invasion of Earth by <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/the-combine/3015-64/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-64\">the Combine</a>. </p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>What has made this franchise so popular is the use of the portal gun, a gun that lets you shoot two portals.

This is the only weapon you get in the game and must use it to get around obstacles. Some walls don't let you shoot portals at them, automated turrets that you have to knock over and some puzzles even demand you launch yourself through in a portal in order to get over certain obstacles.</p><p>Portal 2 introduced many new mechanics including lasers, refraction cubes, ariel faith plates and gel.

The parks are arranged on an <a href=\"/isometric-viewpoint/3015-246/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-246\">isometric</a> grid that the player has full view of, allowing the player to modify their park's landscape, rides, scenery, etc. As time passes the player must work to keep the guests satisfied and entertained by expanding the park's selection of rides and ensuring it is well kept. The core of each game consists of a series of scenarios of varying difficulty that challenge players to meet certain goals, such as maintaining a highly rated park or attracting a number of guests. In later installments a <a href=\"/sandbox/3015-453/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-453\">sandbox</a> mode was added, giving players free reign over a park without the encumbrance of a goal.</p><p> </p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5302/2499449-rollercoaster_tycoon_logo.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2499449\" data-ratio=\"0.65217391304348\" data-width=\"230\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 230px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:65.2%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5302/2499449-rollercoaster_tycoon_logo.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2499449\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/5302/2499449-rollercoaster_tycoon_logo.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/5302/2499449-rollercoaster_tycoon_logo.png 230w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 230px) 100vw, 230px\" data-width=\"230\"></a></figure><p>In order to create a thriving park the player must successfully manage all aspects of a theme park. While remaining under budget, utilizing the vast assortment of rides, food and service stalls, and scenery is key to creating a well-rounded park that keeps everyone happy. Other management necessities include hiring mechanics and janitors to make sure the park stays functional and clean. Failure to properly maintain and continually expand the park could mean a drop in park ratings, a decline in guests, or even crippling debt.</p><p> </p><p>An array of true to life rides are at the player's disposal when constructing their park. From <a href=\"/ferris-wheel/3055-998/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-998\">Ferris wheels</a> to log rides, the player is able to create life-like parks that offer entertainment for anyone. The franchise is perhaps best known for its roller coaster creator, which gives players full control of the construction of their own custom roller coasters (as well as any other rides that consist of a track-design, like log flumes). The creator allows individual track pieces to be laid out, letting players choose the direction, slope, bank, and height of each one, as well as offering the player a variety of other roller coaster elements, such as vertical loops, corkscrews, and helices. Roller coasters can be tested to ensure they operate to the expectations of the player, and are given ratings to note how intense, entertaining, and vomit-inducing they are (non-coaster rides also have these ratings). These ratings are affected by calculated data for each coaster, including its average speed, number of drops, and the g-force exerted on the riders. Depending on a ride's ratings, it may be received well or poorly by guests, cause guests to become sick, or prove to be too intense for everyone but the most extreme roller coaster enthusiasts.</p><p> </p><h2>Games</h2><h3>RollerCoaster Tycoon</h3><p>Released on March 31, 1999, the original <a href=\"/rollercoaster-tycoon/3030-2236/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2236\">RollerCoaster Tycoon</a> was at first intended to be a sequel to Chris Sawyer's other hit simulation game <a href=\"/transport-tycoon/3030-9515/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9515\">Transport Tycoon</a>. After Sawyer picked up a fascination for roller coasters, however, RollerCoaster Tycoon was born. Written almost entirely in assembly language, the original RollerCoaster Tycoon featured 22 scenarios, with a new one becoming unlocked after the completion of another. Each scenario is a new park with a new goal, some parks and rides being based on real life counterparts. The final scenario, Mega Park, has no other objective than to \"Have Fun!\", although is still not a true sandbox level due to a limited player budget.

This pack added new roller coaster types and scenery (including the well-known banner sign) on top of the already large selection of the original game.</p><p> </p><h4>Loopy Landscapes</h4><p><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/rollercoaster-tycoon-loopy-landscapes/3030-14131/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14131\">Loopy Landscapes</a> includes the preceding expansion and adds even more rides and scenery, as well as new food/shop stalls, parks, and a whole new list of scenarios. Released September 30, 2000, 30 new scenarios were packed into this expansion, as well an abundance of new building options, which garnered this expansion much higher praise than Corkscrew Follies.</p><p> </p><h4>RollerCoaster Tycoon: Gold</h4><p>This compilation, released in 2002, includes the original game and both the Corkscrew Follies and Loopy Landscapes expansions.</p><p> </p><h4>RollerCoaster Tycoon: Deluxe</h4><p>This compilation, released in 2003, is the same as the Gold compilation, but with more pre-made designs of customizable rides.</p><p> </p><h3>RollerCoaster Tycoon 2</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5302/2499451-rollerbigcoaster.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2499451\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"360\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 360px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5302/2499451-rollerbigcoaster.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2499451\"><img alt=\"Design unique roller coasters\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/5302/2499451-rollerbigcoaster.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/5302/2499451-rollerbigcoaster.jpg 360w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/5302/2499451-rollerbigcoaster.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Design unique roller coasters</figcaption></figure><p>Released October 15, 2002, <a href=\"/rollercoaster-tycoon-2/3030-11178/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11178\">RollerCoaster Tycoon 2</a> is the first sequel to the original. Although it was highly popular, the game was met with some criticism for being a near identical twin to its predecessor with new scenarios and a large ranger of riders, shops, and other building options. The gameplay itself was largely unchanged. Some new additions, however, earned high praise, such as the scenario editor for user-created scenarios and the more advanced tools for scenery placement. Licensed by Six Flags, the game also features five playable Six Flags theme parks. Also unlike its predecessor, most of the scenarios are unlocked from the beginning, and are divided into groups based on their difficulty. This would be the last RollerCoaster Tycoon game that Chris Sawyer would bet he lead designer on, though he would remain as a consultant for many of the forthcoming titles.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h4>RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 Wacky Worlds</h4><p>Released May 6 2003, <a href=\"/rollercoaster-tycoon-2-wacky-worlds/3030-8793/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8793\">Wacky Worlds</a> is the first expansion to RollerCoaster Tycoon 2. This expansion added more scenarios and many new scenery and ride themes, inspired from locations around the world, such as London and Japan. It was met with some criticism because any \"new\" rides that were included were simply re-themed versions of already-included rides.</p><p> </p><h4>RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 Time Twister</h4><p>Much like Wacky Worlds, <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/rollercoaster-tycoon-2-time-twister/3030-2415/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2415\">Time Twister</a>, released on August 15, 2003, added more scenarios and themes, yet was again criticized for the lack of gameplay changes and new rides.

With a now fully-rotational viewpoint (though there is an optional isometric viewpoint), players can see their park from any angle. Many new gameplay changes were introduced to the series as well, such as the CoasterCam, which allows players to ride their rides in first person view. Other new features include musically-coordinated fireworks shows, guests (now known as \"peeps\") of varying ages and gender, and the highly desired sandbox mode, which put players in charge of an empty park with no monetary, time, or goal restrictions. Similarly to the original RollerCoaster Tycoon, most of the scenarios are locked at the start, requiring players to complete unlocked scenarios before they are able to move on to the next. The game also improves sharing functionality between players, allowing them to easily import and export custom rides, scenarios, and scenery.</p><p> </p><h4>RollerCoaster Tycoon 3: Soaked!</h4><p><a href=\"/rollercoaster-tycoon-3-soaked/3030-1001/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1001\">Soaked!</a>, released March 17, 2005, is the first expansion for RollerCoaster Tycoon 3.

The first Pro Evolution game, released in 2001 for PSOne and PS2, game grew out of Konami's previous soccer series International Superstar Soccer. Created as a rival to EAs Fifa Soccer series, Pro Evo defined itself as a realistic simulation, paying more attention to the technicalities of the sport than aquiring likeness rights for the players. Pro Evolution has stayed true to the series' name and recieved annual updates, each version refining the game's many mechanics including tacking, shooting, passing and the game's greatest challenge, the Master League mode. The primary focus of the single player game, the Master League challenges players to take control of a team of unknown and unskilled players, slowly earning points to enter the transfer market and improve the squad. The players age as time goes on, necessitating development and tactical considerations at all levels of play. The series is currently on its eight iteration, Pro Evolution 2008, due in the fall.<br/><br/><h2>Pro Evolution Soccer VS. FIFA</h2><h3>Graphics</h3>Graphics wise FIFA has a reputation as always being visually superior to PES, with EA focussing on this area heavily between each release while Pro Evolution never really refreshing between installments. Some graphical issues with Pro Evolution games in the past have been some questionable animations and on the latest PES game the player models all seem fairly bulky, meanwhile EA goes from strength to strength both in terms of the players and their movements but also stadiums and cut scenes that add to the polish of the game.<br/><br/><h3>Licences</h3>FIFA controls the license for the Barclays Premier League which is probably the most saught after license around considering the games major demographic will be from England and the Premiership is considered one of Europe's top 3 leagues. FIFA also has many teams from Serie A and a complete La Liga license whereas PES offers a couple of licensed Premiership teams, around half of La Liga licensed and the complete Serie A. In PES the unlicensed teams have fake names and poor quality kits that are often completely the wrong colour. In PES 2009 Konami have released two patches that add licenses that were not present in the original game such as Atletico Madrid and further patches are expected. However in 2009 PES sealed exclusive rights to the Champions League, Europe's premier club competition that is a large coup for Konami against EA and although the license translates well there is also criticisms that it should be integrated into the online and Master League modes.\u00a0\u00a0<br/><br/> <b><h3>League systems</h3></b>FIFA's manager mode shows greater depth than PES's master league offering both in terms of the transfer dealings, staff upgrades, youth academy and stadium options but also in terms of the competitions availible. Criticisms levelled at PES are that there is a lack of a real currency in the Master League and an update is long overdue for the mode.<br/><br/><h3>Commentary</h3>Commentary has always been historically poor with PES although the lead commentator from PES up until PES 6 Peter Brackley has a strong cult following among fans of the series and other fans. The major English sporting commentators that you see on television in England have ties to FIFA whereas PES has a television pundit and a fairly major commentator although not on par with FIFA's names.<br/><br/><h2>Commentators</h2>Pro evolution soccer 2 \u2013 Peter Brackley and Trevor Brooking (English)<br/>Pro evolution soccer 2 \u2013 Peter Brackley and Trevor Brooking (English)<br/>Pro evolution soccer 3 \u2013 Peter Brackley and Trevor Brooking (English)<br/>Pro evolution soccer 4 \u2013 Peter Brackley and Trevor Brooking (English)<br/>Pro evolution soccer 5 \u2013 Peter Brackley and Trevor Brooking (English)<br/>Pro evolution soccer 6 \u2013 Peter Brackley and Trevor Brooking (English)<br/><br/>Pro evolution soccer 2008 \u2013 <br/><br/>The United Kingdom -

These are distributed via the internet in digital format, then transferred to the Playstation 2 memory card using hardware such as the Max Drive. More experienced gamers often use \"patches\", editing the actual game code and modifying the graphical content to include accurate kits for unlicensed teams, new stadiums, and footballs from Nike, Inc., Puma, Umbro and Mitre, as well as more Adidas balls. Most patches also contain licensed referee kits from FIFA and the official logos of the various European leagues. Since these patches are technically a breach of copyright, and are often sold illegally in territories in the Middle East and Asia, Konami have become less tolerant of this kind of fan editing in recent years, and now encrypt the data pertaining to kits and player statistics in each new release. However, fan communities invariably find ways to crack this encryption, and patches still appear once this has been achieved.<br/><br/><h3>Legal Threats</h3>Konami have not taken steps to prevent translation patches, which convert the game text from Japanese to English (or any other language). Thus, it is still easy for gamers outside Japan to purchase the game and patch it into their own language, provided they have a modified PS2 capable of playing backup copies.", "guid": "3025-596", "name": "Pro Evolution Soccer"}, {"description": "<p><strong>DJMAX</strong> is a series of rhythm action games developed by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-5732\" href=\"/pentavision-entertainment/3010-5732/\" slug=\"pentavision-entertainment\">Pentavision</a>, a South Korean developer. The first game in the series, <strong><a data-ref-id=\"3030-20270\" href=\"/djmax/3030-20270/\" slug=\"djmax\">DJMAX</a></strong>, commonly known as DJMAX Online, was a <a data-ref-id=\"3045-94\" href=\"/pc/3045-94/\" slug=\"pc\">PC</a> only title, whilst several sequels have been spawned on both the PC and <a data-ref-id=\"3045-18\" href=\"/psp/3045-18/\" slug=\"psp\">Playstation Portable</a>.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The DJMAX series of games is very similar in gameplay to <strong><a data-ref-id=\"3025-853\" href=\"/beatmania-iidx/3025-853/\" slug=\"beatmania-iidx\">Beatmania IIDX</a></strong> and <strong><a data-ref-id=\"3025-56\" href=\"/beatmania/3025-56/\" slug=\"beatmania\">Beatmania</a></strong>, two rhythm action game franchises created by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-87\" href=\"/konami-corporation/3010-87/\" slug=\"konami-corporation\">Konami</a>, primarily for release in Japan. Horizontal lines, also known as notes, descend from the top of the screen to the bottom where they reach a target area. As they reach the bottom, the player has to hit the corresponding key on the controller (Either the PSP face buttons, shoulder buttons and d-pad or specific keys on a keyboard) in order to play a 'key sound'. A key sound is a small part of the song being played, so if the player hits all the notes sucessfully, they hear the entire song correctly. Players can choose how many different buttons they want to play with; in the various DJMAX games, anything from two button play up to eight button play is available, with the exception of three and seven button. Players are judged on their accuracy in hitting notes, given a percentage accuracy. 100% is a perfectly timed press, whilst the game scores anything less accurate at 10% intervals, so 90%, 80% all the way down to 10% and finally 1% then a complete miss.</p><p>DJMAX also uses a 'Fever' system, vaguely similar to Star Power from the Guitar Hero series. Players can trigger Fever mode after they have sucessfully hit enough notes, causing the game to raise their score and combo multiplier by one. The highest level of Fever varies from game to game, with newer games featuring a maximum of seven over the previous maximum of five. Whilst Fever mode is activated, if the player does not trigger the next level of Fever quick enough, their multiplier is reduced back to one. Depending on the version of DJMAX, this either happens after the player has hit a certain number of notes, or after a set amount of time.</p><p>There are various play modes in the DJMAX series. Most games have a standard play mode, where the player plays four songs in sucession using the number of keys of their choice, a challenge mode, where the player plays a specific set of songs in order to achieve a preset criteria to pass, and modes for playing back the songs and music videos featured in the game. DJMAX games are feature significant numbers of unlockable bonuses, from extra songs and skins, additional modes of play, modifiers to existing gameplay and assists to aid the player in achieving better scores or passing harder songs.</p><h2>Legal Action</h2><p>As of the 25th of December 2008, Konami's Korean division is taking legal action against the creators of the DJMAX franchise due to similarities between the Beatmania series of games and the DJMAX titles.

The case called into question the interface used in the PC and PSP versions of the franchise as well as the keysounding implementation across all games and their similarities to beatmania. This case was settled out of court with production of the franchise unaffected in the end.

The game was originally planned as an unrelated game in Japan, but it was never released there. Contra Force was released on the NES in September of 1992. The game is generally lesser received than the other games in the franchise, mostly due to its departure from the regular gameplay that the franchise is known for. The game was originally announced in a Japanese flyer under the title Arc Hound, a game completely unrelated to the Contra franchise. The game takes place in the fictional Neo City, and stars a group known as Blue Group, an anti-terrorist group.</p><h3>Contra: Hard Corps (Genesis)</h3><p><a href=\"/contra-hard-corps/3030-13902/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13902\">Contra: Hard Corps</a> was the first game to feature a female character--and even a werewolf. This game is widely recognized as the hardest in the series. Contra: Hard Corps was released on September 14, 1994. Contra: Hard Corps switched up the gameplay just a little bit by making it so that the game was less just enemies, and more boss encounters. There were also multiple endings in the game. The game was set in 2641, five years after the events of Contra III. The threat of the alien wars is over, and now to keep the peace, the Hard Corps has been established. A hero from the alien wars has kept an alien cell, and it is up to the Hard Corps to keep him from taking over the world.</p><h3>Contra: Legacy of War (PlayStation, Saturn)</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6150/496873-cover.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-496873\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.97571277719113\" data-width=\"947\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 947px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:97.6%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6150/496873-cover.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-496873\"><img alt=\"Contra: Legacy of War\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/6150/496873-cover.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/6150/496873-cover.jpg 947w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/6150/496873-cover.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/6150/496873-cover.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Contra: Legacy of War\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/6150/496873-cover.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/6150/496873-cover.jpg 947w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/6150/496873-cover.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/6150/496873-cover.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Contra: Legacy of War</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/contra-legacy-of-war/3030-14566/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14566\">Contra: Legacy of War</a> was the first Contra title to be developed by <a href=\"/appaloosa-interactive/3010-2652/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2652\">Appaloosa Interactive</a>.

Instead, the player is tasked with dodging bosses' spell cards while attempting to take pictures of the boss. The player's photos are then judged by a number of factors, including the boss' visibility, the number of bullets included in the shot, and more.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/touhou-01-highly-responsive-to-prayers/3030-21805/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21928\">Touhou 9.5 - Shoot the Bullet</a></li><li><a href=\"/touhou-10-mountain-of-faith/3030-21326/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21326\">Touhou 12.5 - Double Spoiler</a></li><li><a href=\"/touhou-128-fairy-wars/3030-32226/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-32226\">Touhou 16.5 - Violet Detector</a></li></ul><h4>Other Spin-offs</h4><ul><li><a href=\"/touhou-128-fairy-wars/3030-32226/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-32226\">Touhou 12.8 - Fairy Wars</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/touhou-143-impossible-spell-card/3030-45976/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-45976\">Touhou 14.3 - Impossible Spell Card</a></li><li><a href=\"/touhou-185-100th-black-market/3030-87099/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-87099\">Touhou 18.5 - 100th Black Market</a></li></ul><h2>Fangames</h2><p>Given the series' notable popularity, a large number of fangames have been made featuring characters, locations, music, and mechanics from the Touhou Project series. This is further bolstered by ZUN's frequent efforts to encourage Touhou fangames, including putting very few restrictions around the use of Touhou characters as well as working with Mediascape on the \"Play, Doujin!\" project, a publishing project dedicated to licensing and releasing Touhou fangames commercially.</p>", "guid": "3025-606", "name": "Touhou Project"}, {"description": "<p>Quest for Glory is a series of adventure-RPG games possessing elements of both the old Sierra adventure games and their inventory-based puzzles, and RPG elements like statistics and combat. The player starts as an up-and-coming adventurer who wants to become a hero, and can choose between three (eventually four) different character classes, each with unique abilities that color their approach to obstacles. Featuring recurring characters and the ability to import a character from game to game, the series can be experienced as one long story over as many as five separate games.</p><p> </p><h2>Character classes</h2><p>Each character class possesses a default skill set; however, players can spend customization points during the creation of their character to obtain skills their character class would not usually have. This means the classes can be hybridized to some extent; however, the game will still regard the player as possessing one class, and some events or abilities will still be available only to a certain class regardless of skills.</p><p> </p><h3>The Fighter</h3><p>Aside from his sword or battle axe, everything about the Fighter is blunt. His approach to combat is to get in close and hack away, and obstacles will generally be pushed, endured, or hit.</p><h3> </h3><h3>The Magic User</h3><p>The Magic User posses few physical skills and relies on his spells in all aspects of the hero's life.</p><h3> </h3><h3>The Thief</h3><p>The Thief is not a champion of combat, but his skill in stealth will often carry him past danger. The Thief's lock-picking skills allow him to break into villain's fortresses and people's homes with equal ease. A hero of grayer morality, the Thief steals from the rich and the poor, but in the end he'll rescue the land, as well.</p><h3> </h3><h3>The Paladin</h3><p>The Paladin has some similarities to the Fighter class, generally preferring to engage in close-range combat with his fiery-blue sword. However, he can gain access to magic and special Paladin powers as well, and focuses more on helping others during his adventures.</p><p>The Paladin class is not available in the first game, but heroes of other classes can eventually become a Paladin if they prove themselves worthy.</p><h2> </h2><h2>Series structure</h2><p>Series creators Corey and Lori Cole originally envisioned the series as a tetralogy, with each of the four games set in a different location and each corresponding to a different cardinal direction, classical element (earth, fire, air and water) and season. Later, an additional game was inserted into the cycle, bringing the series total to five games.</p><p> </p><h4><a href=\"/quest-for-glory-i-so-you-want-to-be-a-hero/3030-20243/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20243\">Quest for Glory I: So You Want to Be a Hero</a></h4><p>The first game in the series sees a young, untested hero arriving in Spielburg, a small mountain town troubled by brigands and an evil witch. The setting is inspired by Germanic folklore. It is themed around the Spring season, the element of earth, and the cardinal direction of North. The game was first released in 1989 using EGA graphics and a text parser interface. Sierra remade the game in 1992 with VGA graphics and a mouse-driven interface.</p><h4> </h4><h4><a href=\"/quest-for-glory-ii-trial-by-fire/3030-16532/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16532\">Quest for Glory II: Trial by Fire</a></h4><p>The hero travels into the southern deserts to the twin cities of Shapeir and Raseir, where he must face rampaging elementals and a wizard intent on conquering the world. The setting is inspired by Arabian Nights folklore. Its theme season is Summer, its element is fire, and its cardinal direction is South. The EGA version of the game was released in 1990. This was the only Quest of Glory game that was not officially released or re-released using a newer point-and-click interface. In 2008, <a href=\"/agd-interactive/3010-2225/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2225\">AGD Interactive</a> released a freeware fan remake in the style of Sierra's point-and-click adventures with enhanced graphics.</p><h4> </h4><h4><a href=\"/quest-for-glory-iii-wages-of-war/3030-7782/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7782\">Quest for Glory III: Wages of War</a></h4><p>The hero explores the savannahs and jungles of Tarna, uncovering a plot to incite war between the Simbani tribe and the Leopardmen. The game's setting is based on African mythology. This 1992 release was not part of the original planned series, and as such does not have a thematic season, element or direction.</p><h4> </h4><h4><a href=\"/quest-for-glory-iv-shadows-of-darkness/3030-11357/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11357\">Quest for Glory IV: Shadows of Darkness</a></h4><p>The hero is transported to Mordavia, a Transylvania-inspired land of mists and fog, where he is entangled in a plot by the villain Ad Avis to summon a dark god. Released in 1994, Shadows of Darkness was themed around the Autumn season, the element of air, and the cardinal direction of East.</p><h4> </h4><h4><a href=\"/quest-for-glory-v-dragon-fire/3030-11799/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11799\">Quest for Glory V: Dragon Fire</a></h4><p>The hero's journey comes to a conclusion as he competes to win the crown of the kingdom of Silmaria and to defeat a dragon. The game's setting is inspired by Greece, its season is Winter, its element is water, and its direction is West. Released in 1998, this final game in the series uses a different game engine with more emphasis on action role-playing rather than traditional adventure gaming.</p><h2> </h2><h2>Patches</h2><p>With the exception of Dragon Fire, the QFG games were originally released for DOS, and thus experience timing issues when running on newer, faster computers. Most notorious is the \"For what have you come, friend of Rakeesh?\" bug in Wages of War, wherein the Simbani leader repeats that line over and over without allowing the player to act, forcing a restart. These timing bugs have been fixed with patches made by fan \"NewRisingSun\", and are available <a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/belzorash/\" rel=\"nofollow \">here</a>. Patches are available for other classic adventure games, as well; running the games in <a href=\"http://www.dosbox.com\" rel=\"nofollow \">DOSBox</a>, an open-source DOS emulator, also helps with functionality (as well as providing players with the ability to run the games on non-Windows platforms such as Mac OS X and Linux).</p>", "guid": "3025-607", "name": "Quest for Glory"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-608", "name": "No One Lives Forever"}, {"description": "<h2 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Overview</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The FIFA series began life in 1993, and although there had been several soccer games released before it, FIFA International Soccer was the first game to ever feature the official license from FIFA, the governing world body for soccer.

During <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/e3-2013/3015-7534/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7534\">E3 2013</a>, however, Square Enix unveiled the game once more, and also revealed that it is now <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/final-fantasy-xv/3030-21006/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21006\">Final Fantasy XV</a>.</p><p>The degree to which the games in the Fabula Nova Crystalis franchise hold to the mythos varies from game to game. The Final Fantasy XIII trilogy delves heavily into it, frequently ultilizing its concepts and terminology. The latter games in the trilogy also see more direct action from the pantheon goddess <a href=\"/etro/3005-22611/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-22611\">Etro</a> and the almighty god <a href=\"/bhunivelze/3005-28511/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-28511\">Bhunivelze</a>. By comparison, Final Fantasy Type-0 does not feature a heavy reliance on the mythology, and Final Fantasy XV will make use of its own interpretation.</p>", "guid": "3025-612", "name": "Fabula Nova Crystallis"}, {"description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>The <em>Tales of</em> franchise is a series of roleplaying games published by Bandai Namco with a unique battle system and widespread popularity, especially in Japan.</p><p>As indicated by the name of the franchise, each title in the Tales of series starts with \"Tales of...\". The name was born with the first game, <a href=\"/tales-of-phantasia/3030-255/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-255\">Tales of Phantasia</a>, released on the Super Famicom in 1995. Traditionally, the titles have next to nothing to do with the actual game; for example, Tales of Phantasia does not take place in a land called \"Phantasia\", and <a href=\"/tales-of-the-abyss/3030-14210/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14210\">Tales of The Abyss</a> has nothing to do with anything called 'the abyss'. <a href=\"/tales-of-vesperia/3030-20836/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20836\">Tales of Vesperia</a>, however, is relevant for Vesperia being the name of the guild formed by protagonists <a href=\"/yuri-lowell/3005-4202/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4202\">Yuri Lowell</a> and <a href=\"/karol-capel/3005-4214/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4214\">Karol Capel</a>, which itself is named after what is described as the 'brightest star in the sky'.</p><p>During a press conference in 2007, the series' main producer, Makoto Yoshizumi, stated that the Tales games can be divided into two distinct categories: \"Mothership Titles\" and \"Escort Titles\". The former games present a canon storyline, while the latter are a number of titles that include spin-offs and side games. However, since nearly all of the games take place in their own completely separate, unrelated universes, this distinction is of course totally meaningless.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>In each Tales of game, enemy encounters are played out using a combat engine called the <a href=\"/linear-motion-battle-system/3015-219/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-219\">Linear Motion Battle System</a>, or L.M.B.S.</p><p>In L.M.B.S., the fight is played out on a two-dimensional axis that usually stretches wider than a single screen width. So the screen can scroll to the left and to the right, depending on where the characters and opponents are relatively located. L.M.B.S. contains a pause menu during battle which lets the player select a spell or item. As in some fighting games, it is possible to assign items or combination moves to specific buttons as shortcuts for quick actions.</p><p>As opposed to most other turn-based systems, which allow the player to control every party member, L.M.B.S. (usually) only allows direct control of one character. Other characters in the party can be set to passive mode (defending themselves only) or active mode (full computer controlled). Additionally, some games in the series buck tradition by allowing the player to order the other characters to move to a given spot or use a specific spell or ability from the pause menu. For the titles that allow multiplayer, the other party characters can be controlled directly in combat by other human players.</p>", "guid": "3025-613", "name": "Tales"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-614", "name": "Solomon's Key"}, {"description": "<p>This is part of the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/final-fantasy/3025-194/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-194\">Final Fantasy</a> franchise's <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/ivalice-alliance/3025-697/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-697\">Ivalice Alliance</a> series.</p><p> </p>", "guid": "3025-615", "name": "Final Fantasy Tactics"}, {"description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Begun in 2007, the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. franchise is a series of video games set in \"The Zone\", an area covering Chernobyl and its surroundings following a fictional second Chernobyl disaster. Loosely inspired by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky's novel <em>Roadside Picnic</em>, the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series follows the lives of \"stalkers\", inhabitants of The Zone. Besides other stalkers, The Zone is covered with a number of dangers, from \"anomalies\" which destroy any object passing through them, to mutated wildlife and psychically-powered experiments.</p><h2>Games</h2><h3>S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl</h3><p>Released in 2007, <a href=\"/stalker-shadow-of-chernobyl/3030-11725/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11725\">S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl</a> takes place in 2012, 6 years after the second Chernobyl incident. The game follows an amnesiac stalker referred to as \"The Marked One\", whose only link to his past is a note telling him to \"Kill Strelok.\" The first entry in the series, Shadow of Chernobyl received fairly positive reception, eventually becoming a cult classic. However, the game was (and remains) infamous for its high number of bugs, many of which persist even following community efforts to patch some of the game's technical issues.</p><h3>S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky</h3><p>Released in 2008, <a href=\"/stalker-clear-sky/3030-21302/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21302\">S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky</a> is a prequel to the original game, set one year prior. The player takes the role of Scar, a mercenary tasked with stopping a group of stalkers led by Strelok, before they can reach the center of The Zone. Clear Sky introduced more defined mechanics around in-game factions and their relations to one another, but was received slightly less favorably than Shadow of Chernobyl, in part due to a continued abundance of bugs.</p><h3>S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat</h3><p>Released in 2009, <a href=\"/stalker-call-of-pripyat/3030-26119/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-26119\">S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat</a> is the third game in the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series. It takes place after Shadow of Chernobyl left, albeit from the perspective of a new character, Major Degtyarev. Degtyarey is sent into The Zone in attempts to blend in with the other stalkers, so as to ascertain the fate of a squad of men who crash-landed in the Zone. Call of Pripyat widely overhauled the UI of the previous games, as well as adding new features such as \"safe zones\", areas in which violence is prohibited, to act as quest hubs, alongside new areas, and a slew of miscellaneous improvements to the game's foundation.</p><h3>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2</h3><p>Originally announced in 2010 with a planned 2012 release, <a href=\"/stalker-2-heart-of-chernobyl/3030-32327/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-32327\">S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2</a> was intended for PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3.

The main focus of the gameplay centers around leading up to three different squads with one usually being a fire team used to <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1082\" href=\"/suppressive-fire/3015-1082/\" slug=\"suppressive-fire\">suppress</a> the enemy and the other bring an assault team used to <a data-ref-id=\"3015-415\" href=\"/flanking/3015-415/\" slug=\"flanking\">flank</a> the enemy.

In the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-617\" href=\"/brothers-in-arms/3025-617/\" slug=\"brothers-in-arms\">Brothers in Arms</a> series, this is not the case as individual characters are comparatively fragile. The player must use their squad effectively to exploit weaknesses in the enemies' defense to flank them and then destroy them. At various points throughout the series, the player will also gain control of new units, such as <a data-ref-id=\"3055-92\" href=\"/tank/3055-92/\" slug=\"tank\">tanks</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3055-899\" href=\"/mortar/3055-899/\" slug=\"mortar\">mortars</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3055-2394\" href=\"/bazooka/3055-2394/\" slug=\"bazooka\">bazooka</a> squads and <a data-ref-id=\"3055-608\" href=\"/machine-gun/3055-608/\" slug=\"machine-gun\">machine gunners</a>.</p><h2>Storytelling</h2><p>A major feature of the series is its focus on storytelling.
