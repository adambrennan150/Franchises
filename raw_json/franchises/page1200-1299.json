Health is regenerated when the player manages to stay hidden for some time, utilizing cover to the player's benefit. In order to take full advantage of cover, the player is able to stand, crouch, or lie down, losing mobility the closer to the ground the character gets. Staying behind cover completely regenerates the character's health, although there are a variety of one-hit kill weapons, such as being knifed or blown up (either by <a data-ref-id=\"3055-111\" href=\"/grenade/3055-111/\" slug=\"grenade\">grenade</a>, grenade launcher, or another form of explosive).</p><h3>Multiplayer</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1113027-t_modernw2_mp_hd_52.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1113027\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1113027-t_modernw2_mp_hd_52.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1113027\"><img alt=\"The Modern Warfare franchise has a variety of traditional multiplayer modes\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/669/1113027-t_modernw2_mp_hd_52.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/669/1113027-t_modernw2_mp_hd_52.jpg 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/0/669/1113027-t_modernw2_mp_hd_52.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1113027-t_modernw2_mp_hd_52.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/669/1113027-t_modernw2_mp_hd_52.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Modern Warfare franchise has a variety of traditional multiplayer modes\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/669/1113027-t_modernw2_mp_hd_52.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/669/1113027-t_modernw2_mp_hd_52.jpg 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/0/669/1113027-t_modernw2_mp_hd_52.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1113027-t_modernw2_mp_hd_52.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/669/1113027-t_modernw2_mp_hd_52.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Modern Warfare franchise has a variety of traditional multiplayer modes</figcaption></figure><p>The multiplayer of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-2133\" href=\"/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare/3030-2133/\" slug=\"call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare\">Call of Duty 4</a> introduced a variety of concepts which are now considered standard in first person shooters.

Experience causes the player to level up, with the final goal of level 56 (level 70 in Modern Warfare 2). Each level unlocks something, such as a new game mode, a new weapon, a new perk, or a new challenge. After reaching level 56, the player has the option to Prestige, which gives the player a new insignia, but forces the player to completely start over at level one. The option to Prestige is only open ten times, allowing the player to level up a grand total of 560 times (700 times in Modern Warfare 2).</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1113025-t_modernw2_mp_hd_50.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1113025\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1113025-t_modernw2_mp_hd_50.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1113025\"><img alt=\"Players can control AC130 gunships as a killstreak.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/669/1113025-t_modernw2_mp_hd_50.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/669/1113025-t_modernw2_mp_hd_50.jpg 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/0/669/1113025-t_modernw2_mp_hd_50.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1113025-t_modernw2_mp_hd_50.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/669/1113025-t_modernw2_mp_hd_50.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Players can control AC130 gunships as a killstreak.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/669/1113025-t_modernw2_mp_hd_50.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/669/1113025-t_modernw2_mp_hd_50.jpg 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/0/669/1113025-t_modernw2_mp_hd_50.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1113025-t_modernw2_mp_hd_50.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/669/1113025-t_modernw2_mp_hd_50.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Players can control AC130 gunships as a killstreak.</figcaption></figure><p><a data-ref-id=\"3015-1840\" href=\"/kill-streak/3015-1840/\" slug=\"kill-streak\">Killstreaks</a> are another feature of the Modern Warfare 2 franchise.

Weapon loadouts can be customized, as well as the attachments (e.g. red dot sights, grenade launchers, etc), as well as equipment such as claymores, C4, frag grenades, etc. Perks allow for a variety of bonuses, including invisibility on the enemy radar, increasing sprint distance, or increased bullet damage.

After requesting extraction, General Shepherd personally comes and kills them himself, shooting them and burning their bodies. When Soap and Price learn of this betrayal, they narrowly escape a firefight between Makarov and Shepherd's soldiers, after being rescued by Nikolai (the Russian contact they worked with in Call of Duty 4). They manage to learn Shepherd's location after making contact with Makarov, and set out to kill him.</p><p>Infiltrating Shepherd's base, Soap and Price manage to pursue Shepherd to a dock, where a boat chase begins. After managing to ramp his boat into a helicopter, Shepherd is shot down by Price, right before their own boat goes off a waterfall. Recovering from the fall, all three men are badly injured. Soap tries to stab Shepherd, although he fails and is kicked to the ground. In the final scenes, Price and Shepherd struggle while Soap helplessly watches, with a knife in the chest. However, he manages to pull it out of his chest and throw the knife directly at Shepherd, killing him. The game ends as the two are extracted by Nikolai, their Russian informant from Call of Duty 4, who remains an ally.</p><h2>Modern Warfare 2: Ghost</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1328336-mw2_ghost_cover.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1328336\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5451388888889\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:154.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1328336-mw2_ghost_cover.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1328336\"><img alt=\"Modern Warfare 2: Ghost\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 288px) 100vw, 288px\" data-width=\"288\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/1328336-mw2_ghost_cover.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/1328336-mw2_ghost_cover.png 288w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Modern Warfare 2: Ghost\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/1328336-mw2_ghost_cover.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/1328336-mw2_ghost_cover.png 288w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 288px) 100vw, 288px\" data-width=\"288\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Modern Warfare 2: Ghost</figcaption></figure><p>Modern Warfare 2: Ghost is a comic book following the character <a data-ref-id=\"3005-11957\" href=\"/ghost/3005-11957/\" slug=\"ghost\">Ghost</a> from <a data-ref-id=\"3030-24713\" href=\"/modern-warfare-2/3030-24713/\" slug=\"modern-warfare-2\">Modern Warfare 2</a>.

It was published by DC Comics and ran from September 1986 through October 1987. It was decided that the story would use original characters, as Moore's story would leave many characters dead or unusable in future stories. It was also made into a feature film into 2009 by Zack Snyder and into an episodic game series, Watchmen: The End is Nigh, published the same year by Warner Bros. Entertainment.The story was created by Moore as a means to reflect human anxieties as well as to critique the superhero concept. watchmen takes place in an alternate history version of the United States. In this history the United States won the Vietnam War, thanks in part to the emergence of superheroes in the 1940's and 1960's. But now, on top of being dangerously close to nuclear war with the Soviet Union, costumed vigilantes have been outlawed and most are retired or are working for the government. The story focuses on the personal development and struggles of the protagonists when they are pulled out of retirement when one of their one is murdered and are eventually led to confront a plot to stave off nuclear war by killing millions of people.</p><p>Watchmen uses very heavy symbolism and recurring themes. The book has recieved high critical acclaim from comics critics and from the mainstream press and is regarded as a seminal text of the comic book medium.</p><h2>Video Games</h2><p>There have been two video games based around the Watchmen universe: Watchmen: The End is Nigh and Watchmen: The End is Nigh Part II. The first game was released at the same time as the Zach Snyder directed movie while the second game was released in time for the DVD release of Watchmen. Both games were later released on shelves.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/106662/1541816-watchmen06.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1541816\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.56309523809524\" data-width=\"1680\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1680px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/106662/1541816-watchmen06.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1541816\"><img alt=\"Rorschach, fighting crime.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/10/106662/1541816-watchmen06.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/10/106662/1541816-watchmen06.jpg 1680w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/10/106662/1541816-watchmen06.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/10/106662/1541816-watchmen06.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\"></a><figcaption>Rorschach, fighting crime.</figcaption></figure><p>Both games take place before the movie and tell the adventures of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-6465\" href=\"/rorschach/3005-6465/\">Rorschach</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-6466\" href=\"/nite-owl/3005-6466/\">Nite Owl</a> as they fight crime and serve cold hard justice. Bot games let the player choose to play as Rorschach or Nite Owl. Both characters play differently and have different sets of combos. Games in the Watchmen franchise are extremely linear where players will enter an \"arena\" sealed off by invisible walls that only disappear once all opponents have stopped breathing. The games try to stay true with the comic by having cutscenes in the same art style as the graphic novel and making the environments look seedy. Both games contain extreme violence, especially when playing as Rorschach who doesn't hesitate to slam an enemy's face in the ground 20 times before believing he's dead.</p><p>The games fell short of expectations upon release, garnering mostly negative reviews.</p><h2>Characters</h2><h3>Edward Blake/The Comedian</h3><p>Dead at the start of the story, his murder is the focal point of the story. His actions and personality are revealed in flashbacks and by descriptions by other characters. Richard Reynolds described The Comedian as \"ruthless, cynical, and nihilistic, and yet capable of deeper insights than the others into the role of the costumed hero\". Along with Dr. Manhattan, he is the only government-sanctioned superhero after the Keene Act banning superheroes is passed. Although he attempted to rape the first Silk Spectre in the 1940s, it is later revealed that years later he fathered her daughter Laurie as part of a consensual sexual relationship.</p><h3>Dr. Jon Osterman/Doctor Manhattan</h3><p>The only hero in Watchmen with real \"superpowers\", Dr. Manhattan is contracted by the US government. Jon Osterman gained power over matter when he was caught in an \"Intrinsic Field Subtractor\" in 1959. Moore delved deeply into quantum physics and nuclear theory when creating Doctor Manhattan, unlike other characters, who have less explained origins.</p><h3>Daniel Dreiberg/The Nite Owl</h3><p>He is a retired superhero. He is actually the Second Nite Owl, his predecessor being the retired Hollis Mason.

The film was going to be an amalgamation of different Japanese legends mashed into an Alice in Wonderland type setting. However after Hiroi's pitch was turned down by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kadokawa_Pictures\" rel=\"nofollow \" data-ref-id=\"false\">Studio Daiei</a> the company took the script to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMS_Entertainment\" rel=\"nofollow \" data-ref-id=\"false\">Tokyo Movie Shinsha</a> and reworked the film into an anime series. During this time Tengai Makyou\u2019s long time character designer <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/torajiro-tsujino/3040-93898/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-93898\">Torajiro Tsujino</a>, a TMS animator at the time, joined the project to design the story\u2019s world and characters. Again the project hit a road block when TMS did not approve the anime\u2019s production budget. After two failed attempts Hiroi was introduced to Hudson Soft who wanted to turn his script into a showpiece title for the company\u2019s upcoming <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/turbografx-cd/3045-53/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-53\">PC Engine-CD</a>. The project changed once again into an RPG and production finally began in 1987 under the title Tengai Makyou: Ziria. However Ziria's development did not go smoothly and after several delays the game was in trouble of being canceled once again until one of Hudson\u2019s PR staffers named <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/shoji-masuda/3040-100839/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-100839\">Shoji Masuda</a> stepped in. Frustrated with the constant delays Masuda decided to get Ziria back on track himself so within 3 months he rewrote the script, reorganized the game\u2019s scale, and created a new battle system. The project was saved and Masuda would later serve as the director/scenario writer for Ziria's <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/tengai-makyou-ii-manjimaru/3030-3928/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3928\">sequel </a>and eventually found his own development studio called <a href=\"/mars-corporation/3010-7527/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-7527\">MARS Corp</a>. <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/tengai-makyou-ziria-haruka-naru-jipang/3030-23450/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-23450\">Tengai Makyou: Ziria</a> was finally released in 1989 where it was met with high praise and strong sales.

Far East of Eden is the title of an imaginary book written by a fake historian named Paul Hieronymus Chada, or P. H. Chada, who is also often credited as being the director of \"Oriental Research Lab #3\" at the Smithsonian. The book, Far East of Eden, is a historical novel about the history of the in-game country of Jipang, which is suppose to be a parody of many Western misconceptions of Japanese culture and history. The story behind the Tengai franchise, as described in the first game's manual, is that Red Company worked with P. H. Chada to adapt his novel into a video game called Tengai Makyou. To honor Tengai Makyou\u2019s \u201csource material\u201d Far East of Eden's title is placed next to the game's logo. So whenever a game in the series has \u201cFar East of Eden\u201d above its logo that means that that specific game takes place in the country of Jipang from Chada's book. There are other entries in the Tengai series, such as <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/oriental-blue-ao-no-tengai/3030-4977/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4977\">Oriental Blue</a> and <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/tengai-makyou-daiyon-no-mokushiroku-the-apocalypse/3030-7045/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7045\">Apocalypse IV</a>, that do not have Far East of Eden in their titles because they are not about the history of Jipang.</p><h2>Sources</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/tengai/tengai.htm\" rel=\"nofollow \" data-ref-id=\"false\">Tengai Makyou Series</a> - Written by Kurt Kalata</li><li><a href=\"http://magweasel.com/2010/06/15/i-love-the-pc-engine-tengai-makyou-ziria/\" rel=\"nofollow \" data-ref-id=\"false\">[I \u2665 The PC Engine] Tengai Makyou Ziria</a> - Written by Kevin Gifford</li></ul>", "guid": "3025-1326", "name": "Tengai Makyou"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-1327", "name": "Zoids"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-1328", "name": "D.Gray-man"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-1329", "name": "Original Generation"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-1330", "name": "Pirates of the Caribbean"}, {"description": "<h2>Overview</h2>", "guid": "3025-1331", "name": "Famicom Detective Club"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-1332", "name": "Shaun White Snowboarding"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-1333", "name": "Lips"}, {"description": "<h2>Links</h2><div><a href=\"http://www.cycling-manager.com/en/\" rel=\"nofollow \">http://www.cycling-manager.com/</a><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\"><a href=\"http://www.cycling-manager.com/en/\" rel=\"nofollow \"> <span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span></a></span>- Official Cycling Manager Site<br/><div><a href=\"http://www.pcmdaily.com/news.php\" rel=\"nofollow \">http://www.pcmdaily.com/</a><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\"><a href=\"http://www.pcmdaily.com/news.php\" rel=\"nofollow \"> </a><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\"><a href=\"http://www.pcmdaily.com/news.php\" rel=\"nofollow \"> </a><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\"><a href=\"http://www.pcmdaily.com/news.php\" rel=\"nofollow \"> <span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span></a></span></span></span>- Internation Cycling Manager Site<br/><div><a href=\"http://www.procyclingmanager.dk/\" rel=\"nofollow \">http://www.procyclingmanager.dk/</a><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\"><a href=\"http://www.procyclingmanager.dk/\" rel=\"nofollow \"> </a><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\"><a href=\"http://www.procyclingmanager.dk/\" rel=\"nofollow \"> </a>-</span> </span>Svandinavian Cycling Manager Site</div><div><br/></div><div><h2>Platforms</h2></div><div>Every Cycling Manager game has been released for the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-94\" href=\"/pc/3045-94/\" slug=\"pc\">PC</a>.

The Left 4 Dead franchise is famous for its cooperative gameplay, an aspect which is seminal to the franchise.</p><p>Both games in the franchise have been very well received, with both games receiving several awards from a variety of publications. Coupled with high sales on both games, Left 4 Dead has proven to be a profitable franchise for Valve. The first game has an aggregate rating of 89% on both Game Rankings and Metacritic, with the second game receiving the same scores on all platforms. Awards include numerous Best Multiplayer Game of 2008 (for the original) and Best Xbox 360 Game of 2009 (Left 4 Dead 2).</p><h3>Controversies</h3><p>The franchise has seen its fair share of controversy as well, surrounding a variety of issues. The first game received significantly less controversy, only receiving minimal negative reception for its \"severed hand\" box art. Left 4 Dead 2, on the other hand, has had a boycott (among gamers believing the sequel came too soon), controversy for its \"severed hand\" box art, racism (for the game's black zombies), and a ban in Australia. The ban in Australia is most notable, as the OFLC refused the game classification (along with other games, such as <a href=\"/fallout-3/3030-20504/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20504\">Fallout 3</a> and <a href=\"/aliens-vs-predator/3030-26532/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-26532\">Aliens vs. Predator</a>).</p><h2>Games</h2><h3>Left 4 Dead</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/628/235325-l4d_final.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-235325\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/628/235325-l4d_final.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-235325\"><img alt=\"Left 4 Dead\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/628/235325-l4d_final.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/628/235325-l4d_final.jpg 689w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/628/235325-l4d_final.jpg 505w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 505px) 100vw, 505px\" data-width=\"505\"></a><figcaption>Left 4 Dead</figcaption></figure><p><b>Released</b>: November 17, 2008</p><p><b>Platforms</b>: PC, Xbox 360</p><p>In the early stages of development, the first Left 4 Dead was being made by Turtle Rock Studios.

Valve released an update after release which added the two missing levels to Versus, and at the same time they put out a free DLC pack which added a new game mode called Survival.</p><p><b>Characters</b></p><ul><li><a href=\"/louis/3005-718/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-718\">Louis</a> (The Business Man)</li><li><a href=\"/zoey/3005-672/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-672\">Zoey</a> (The College Girl)</li><li><a href=\"/francis/3005-702/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-702\">Francis</a> (The Biker)</li><li><a href=\"/bill/3005-711/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-711\">Bill</a> (The Old War Veteran)</li></ul><h3>Left 4 Dead 2</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6733/1042343-l4d2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1042343\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.3896103896104\" data-width=\"462\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 462px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:139.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6733/1042343-l4d2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1042343\"><img alt=\"Left 4 Dead 2\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px\" data-width=\"460\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/6733/1042343-l4d2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/6733/1042343-l4d2.jpg 462w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/6733/1042343-l4d2.jpg 460w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Left 4 Dead 2\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/6733/1042343-l4d2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/6733/1042343-l4d2.jpg 462w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/6733/1042343-l4d2.jpg 460w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px\" data-width=\"460\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Left 4 Dead 2</figcaption></figure><p><b>Released:</b> November 17, 2009</p><p><b>Platforms:</b> PC, Xbox 360</p><p>Left 4 Dead 2 was a controversial game. Many gamers were upset that Valve was releasing a sequel so soon after the first game, and blasted the company for not keeping their promise of supporting the first game with several DLC packs. In addition, the game was banned and censored in Australia and Germany due to the high level of violence.</p><p>Gameplay wise, Left 4 Dead 2 is very similar to its predecessor but it's also a much larger game. At launch, it had five game modes including two new ones called Scavenge and Realism mode. Several new weapons and Special Infected were also included, making the game much more varied than the first one. There are also \"Uncommon Common\" Infected, which are unique zombies that have special traits. Each campaign has one type of uncommon common infected.</p><p><b>Characters</b></p><ul><li><a href=\"/ellis/3005-11063/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11063\">Ellis</a> (The Redneck)</li><li><a href=\"/nick/3005-11061/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11061\">Nick</a> (The Gambler)</li><li><a href=\"/coach/3005-11060/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11060\">Coach</a> (The Big Guy)</li><li><a href=\"/rochelle/3005-11062/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11062\">Rochelle</a> (The Girl)</li></ul><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9838/841212-left4dead_2008_12_20_20_54_20_62.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-841212\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"1680\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1680px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9838/841212-left4dead_2008_12_20_20_54_20_62.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-841212\"><img alt=\"Teamwork is an important aspect of Left 4 Dead.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/9838/841212-left4dead_2008_12_20_20_54_20_62.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/9838/841212-left4dead_2008_12_20_20_54_20_62.jpg 1680w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/0/9838/841212-left4dead_2008_12_20_20_54_20_62.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/9838/841212-left4dead_2008_12_20_20_54_20_62.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/9838/841212-left4dead_2008_12_20_20_54_20_62.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Teamwork is an important aspect of Left 4 Dead.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/9838/841212-left4dead_2008_12_20_20_54_20_62.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/9838/841212-left4dead_2008_12_20_20_54_20_62.jpg 1680w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/0/9838/841212-left4dead_2008_12_20_20_54_20_62.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/9838/841212-left4dead_2008_12_20_20_54_20_62.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/9838/841212-left4dead_2008_12_20_20_54_20_62.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Teamwork is an important aspect of Left 4 Dead.</figcaption></figure><p>A primarily cooperative based experience, the Left 4 Dead series takes place in several different smaller campaigns, rather than a long ongoing experience. This stresses the multiplayer aspect of the series, and the ability to just pick up and play the game. The first game contained four campaigns (No Mercy, Death Toll, Dead Air, and Blood Harvest) while the second game has five (Dead Center, Dark Carnival, Swamp Fever, Hard Rain, and The Parish).</p><p>In single-player or cooperative play through the campaigns, players go through several chapters, fighting zombies and trying to reach the safe house in each chapter. Each campaign also ends with a grand finale or escape vehicle, such as the helicopter in Left 4 Dead 2's Dark Carnival (which, subsequently, ends up being piloted by an infected, leading into Swamp Fever).</p><p>The games each have a variety of weapons with which to dismember, destroy, burn, or shoot zombies. Safe houses contain extra ammunition, health packs, special items (e.g. Molotov cocktails, pipe bombs, etc), and guns. These safe houses are impenetrable from infected individuals until the door is open.</p><p>Each game in the franchise has contained an online component of some sort. The major mode that has been in both games is the versus mode, in which one team plays as the four survivors while the second team plays as the infected. The goal of the infected team is keep the survivors from reaching the safe house. At the end of each chapter, teams are evaluated and given points according to how well they did.</p><p>The infected are broken up into two different types. Normal infected consist of the grunts; these zombies' true power is when the horde attacks en masse. Special infected are varied zombies with special abilities, such as attracting other infected directly to the survivors, singling out and attacking survivors, or even controlling a survivor's movement.</p><h2>Special Infected</h2><h3><a href=\"/the-boomer/3005-13624/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-13624\"><b>The Boomer</b></a></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14741/764681-info_boss_boomer.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-764681\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4181818181818\" data-width=\"220\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 220px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:141.8%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14741/764681-info_boss_boomer.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-764681\"><img alt=\"Boomer\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 220px) 100vw, 220px\" data-width=\"220\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/14741/764681-info_boss_boomer.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/14741/764681-info_boss_boomer.jpg 220w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Boomer\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/14741/764681-info_boss_boomer.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/14741/764681-info_boss_boomer.jpg 220w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 220px) 100vw, 220px\" data-width=\"220\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Boomer</figcaption></figure><p>An obese hunk of flesh, the Boomer is mainly used to indirectly cause damage to the Survivors. His main attack is his ability to puke out bile that covers the Survivors, obscures their vision, and attracts hordes of common Infected. When used well, the Boomer can make the Survivors extremely vulnerable to further attacks from other Special Infected and cause disarray. However, the Boomer is the weakest Special Infected with an astounding 50 hit points. Even though he's easy to kill, it isn't always the best option because upon death the Boomer explodes, spraying bile everywhere which can cover nearby Survivors. This creates a new type of strategy that players sometimes utilize in which they run into a room that the Survivors are hiding in, hoping that they get killed so the humans get covered in the ensuing puke explosion.</p><h3><a href=\"/the-smoker/3005-8537/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-8537\"><b>The Smoker</b></a></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2131/1171409-smoker_l4d.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1171409\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4657980456026\" data-width=\"307\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 307px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:146.6%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2131/1171409-smoker_l4d.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1171409\"><img alt=\"Smoker\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 307px) 100vw, 307px\" data-width=\"307\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/2131/1171409-smoker_l4d.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/2131/1171409-smoker_l4d.jpg 307w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Smoker\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/2131/1171409-smoker_l4d.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/2131/1171409-smoker_l4d.jpg 307w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 307px) 100vw, 307px\" data-width=\"307\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Smoker</figcaption></figure><p>Long and lanky, the Smoker is used to separate Survivors before causing damage. He can be thought of as the sniper of the Special Infected since he almost always attacks from a distance and is often positioned in high places such as rooftops. Using his long tongue, he can snare Survivors and pull them away from the group. While being dragged away, two things could happen. The victim could get caught on something like a vehicle and will then take continuous choking damage until freed (this also happens if the Smoker is on a roof since he cannot drag humans vertically). If the victim is hauled all the way back to the Smoker, the zombie will slash at him with claws. Like the Boomer, the Smoker also has an additional ability that triggers upon death. His body acts like a smoke bomb when he's killed; the surrounding area is covered in smoke for a short while, obscuring vision and causing the Survivors to cough.</p><h3><a href=\"/the-hunter/3005-8538/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-8538\"><b>The Hunter</b></a></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/967/816152-l4d_boss_art_hunter.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-816152\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4611111111111\" data-width=\"900\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 900px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:146.1%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/967/816152-l4d_boss_art_hunter.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-816152\"><img alt=\"Hunter\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 438px) 100vw, 438px\" data-width=\"438\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/967/816152-l4d_boss_art_hunter.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/967/816152-l4d_boss_art_hunter.jpg 900w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/967/816152-l4d_boss_art_hunter.jpg 657w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/967/816152-l4d_boss_art_hunter.jpg 438w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Hunter\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/967/816152-l4d_boss_art_hunter.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/967/816152-l4d_boss_art_hunter.jpg 900w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/967/816152-l4d_boss_art_hunter.jpg 657w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/967/816152-l4d_boss_art_hunter.jpg 438w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 438px) 100vw, 438px\" data-width=\"438\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hunter</figcaption></figure><p>The fast and nimble Hunter can dish out a lot of damage, but usually needs the assistance of the other Special Infected in order to do so. His main ability is his pounce, which enables him to leap on Survivors and claw at them after pinning them to the ground. While he could go about his business alone, doing so will often get him killed easily if he just jumps right into the middle of the Survivors. So, the Hunter usually must work together with the Smoker or even the Boomer to separate or otherwise disorientate the humans before leaping at them. Should the Hunter decide to leap into the middle of the Survivor group, the humans will stumble backwards for a moment which gives him time to deal damage. He is one of the fastest Special Infected due to his insane jumping skill which can be used to scale buildings and cover large amounts of ground very quickly.</p><h3><a href=\"/the-jockey/3005-12184/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-12184\"><b>The Jockey</b></a> (L4D2)</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/1166525-jockey.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1166525\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.99380165289256\" data-width=\"484\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 484px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:99.4%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/1166525-jockey.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1166525\"><img alt=\"Jockey\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/17172/1166525-jockey.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17172/1166525-jockey.png 484w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/17172/1166525-jockey.png 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/17172/1166525-jockey.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Jockey\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/17172/1166525-jockey.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/17172/1166525-jockey.png 484w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/17172/1166525-jockey.png 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/17172/1166525-jockey.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Jockey</figcaption></figure><p>Left 4 Dead 2 introduced the The Jockey who has the speed of the Hunter and the ability to separate Survivors just like the Smoker. However, he isn't as high profile as the Hunter. His main purpose is to sneak up on Survivors and leap on the back of one of them. The Jockey then gains the ability to steer the human away from his friends and possibly into more danger. The player can slow down the influence of the Jockey by trying to move in the opposite direction, but it's impossible to stop the Jockey completely. Like the Hunter, the Jockey can leap, but his jumping distance pales in comparison to that of the Hunter's.</p><h3><a href=\"/the-spitter/3005-11752/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11752\"><b>The Spitter</b></a> (L4D2)</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33486/1089563-spitter.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1089563\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.87265917603\" data-width=\"267\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 267px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:187.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33486/1089563-spitter.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1089563\"><img alt=\"Spitter\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 267px) 100vw, 267px\" data-width=\"267\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/3/33486/1089563-spitter.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/3/33486/1089563-spitter.jpg 267w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spitter\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/3/33486/1089563-spitter.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/3/33486/1089563-spitter.jpg 267w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 267px) 100vw, 267px\" data-width=\"267\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Spitter</figcaption></figure><p>The Spitter is no doubt one of the creepiest of all the Special Infected. Like the Smoker, she is most effective at long range. Her main ability is her projectile spit attack which forms acid pools on the ground. When a Survivor is in the acid pool, they take large amounts of damage that actually increases the longer they stay in it. This ability is useful for downing Survivors that are hiding in small rooms or for temporarily halting them from advancing through a section. The spit does not stick to Survivors, meaning it can't be used to attract common infected.

The survivors who remain must fight their way through hordes of infected individuals, attempting to get to safety. In Left 4 Dead, the four survivors are <a href=\"/francis/3005-702/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-702\">Francis</a>, <a href=\"/bill/3005-711/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-711\">Bill</a>, <a href=\"/zoey/3005-672/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-672\">Zoey</a>, and <a href=\"/louis/3005-718/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-718\">Louis</a>. There is little to no story in Left 4 Dead, with each campaign being completely independent of each other, the only similarity (story-wise) being the four main characters.</p><p>In Left 4 Dead 2, however, Valve put a higher focus on story. Each of the five campaigns link together. Taking place in the southern United States, Left 4 Dead 2 follows <a href=\"/coach/3005-11060/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11060\">Coach</a>, <a href=\"/ellis/3005-11063/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11063\">Ellis</a>, <a href=\"/nick/3005-11061/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11061\">Nick</a>, and <a href=\"/rochelle/3005-11062/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11062\">Rochelle</a> as they make their way to New Orleans, Louisiana. They travel in a variety of vehicles to get there, first making use of a stock car, then a boat (after a helicopter they summoned ends up being piloted by an infected individual). The game ends with a grand finale; the survivors make their way across an exploding bridge, making their way to the last military helicopter leaving New Orleans.</p><p>In both games, each safehouse contains various writings scrawled on the walls from people that passed through earlier. It is through these that the narrative is told. Some of the writing may contain clues as to what lies ahead; some may be from people telling family members where they are heading next; others may simply be for humor (one safehouse in particular has writing from several different people telling how many zombies they've killed).</p>", "guid": "3025-1342", "name": "Left 4 Dead"}, {"description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Crackdown is a series of third-person, action-adventure games published by <a href=\"/xbox-game-studios/3010-340/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-340\">Xbox Game Studios</a>.

It was developed by <a href=\"/realtime-worlds-ltd/3010-2717/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2717\">Realtime Worlds</a>. The game bases itself around a power struggle between three criminal organizations in the large metropolis of <a href=\"/pacific-city/3035-345/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-345\">Pacific City</a>, and ultimately tasks the player with eliminating each of the 21 gang bosses found across the city.</p><p><em>Crackdown</em> was acclaimed for its gameplay design and high draw distances, but drew criticism for lacking a coherent story. Nevertheless, <em>Crackdown</em> went on to become a commercial success, reaching high sales charts across North America, Japan and Europe - largely due in part to the game being bundled with <a href=\"/halo-3/3030-9993/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9993\">Halo 3</a> beta keys. The game is retrospectively viewed as the best in the series, and also as one of the best games released for the Xbox 360.</p><h3><strong><a href=\"/crackdown-2/3030-26790/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-26790\">Crackdown 2</a> (2010)</strong></h3><p><em>Crackdown 2</em> released in July 2010, again as an Xbox 360 exclusive. It takes place 10 years after the first game and focuses on a post-apocalyptic Pacific City which has been ravaged by flesh-eating monsters referred to as <a href=\"/freaks/3015-5656/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5656\">Freaks</a>. Due to the Agency's response to the outbreak, a group of civilians have formed a resistance group called <a href=\"/the-cell/3015-5654/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5654\">Cell</a>, led by ex-Agency scientist <a href=\"/catalina-thorne/3005-15564/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-15564\">Catalina Thorne</a>.</p><p><em>Crackdown 2</em> initially released to mixed reviews. While the game gained positive reception for its improved story and gameplay mechanics, many reviewers noted the game's heavy similarities to the original.</p><h3><strong><a href=\"/crackdown-3/3030-46557/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-46557\">Crackdown 3</a> (2019)</strong></h3><p>The latest game in the series, <em>Crackdown 3</em>, released in February 2019 for <a href=\"/xbox-one/3045-145/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-145\">Xbox One</a> and <a href=\"/pc/3045-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a>. Taking place 10 years after the previous game, Crackdown 3 revolves around an evil organization called TerraNova - who are responsible several blackouts across the world. The Agency have been deployed to the city of <a href=\"/new-providence/3035-7324/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-7324\">New Providence</a> to dismantle TerraNova and confront its leader, Elizabeth Niemand.</p><p>Releasing for <a href=\"/xbox-game-pass/3015-9235/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-9235\">Xbox Game Pass</a>, <em>Crackdown 3</em> gained mixed to negative reception.

By early 2004, the developers at Realtime Worlds already had a working demo of the game and were requested by Microsoft to release the game for the upcoming <a href=\"/xbox-360/3045-20/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-20\">Xbox 360</a> instead. <em>Crackdown</em>'s development cycle switched to the Xbox 360 around this time, with an expected release window for 2006. The game was delayed in early 2006 due to problems concerning the game's updated engine.</p><p>Near the end of the game's development cycle, <em>Crackdown</em> was viewed unfavourably by game testers - which concerned both the developers and Microsoft. As a result, Microsoft decided to bundle the game with beta keys to <em><a href=\"/halo-3/3030-9993/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9993\">Halo 3</a></em>'s multiplayer - which resulted in a strong initial boost to the game's sales when it released in February 2007.</p><h2>Trivia</h2><ul><li>Originally, the first Crackdown had playable female Agents.
