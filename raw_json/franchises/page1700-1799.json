The game was also ported to several platforms and included in various compilations.</p><h3><a href=\"/street-fighter-ii-champion-edition/3030-1096/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1096\"> <b>Street Fighter II': Champion Edition</b></a></h3><p>First released in April 1992 in arcades, Street Fighter II': Champion Edition (where the apostrophe represents \"Dash\" or derivation) allows both players to pick the same character (introducing an alternate color palette for each character) and allows players to play as the four boss characters. Much of the gameplay was revised to balance out the characters and slightly increase the speed. Other changes include background palettes, move distinction between Ryu and Ken, and the new round restriction for continuously tied matches (four rounds instead of ten).</p><h3><a href=\"/street-fighter-ii-turbo-hyper-fighting/3030-8161/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8161\"> <b>Street Fighter II': Hyper Fighting</b></a></h3><p>Known in Japan as Street Fighter II' Turbo: Hyper Fighting, this version (originally released in December 1992) was believed to be developed in response to various unauthorized hacks of Street Fighter II': Champion Edition that introduced ridiculously fast gameplay speed and crazy new special moves. Street Fighter II': Hyper Fighting had the fastest gameplay speed out of all official arcade releases, and introduced a new special move for each of the main eight characters. Characters were balanced even further, making this version the most competitive pre-Super Street Fighter II game. Each character received a new primary color palette, with their alternate color palette being the original. (With the exception of M. Bison, who just received a new alternate color palette)</p><h3><a href=\"/super-street-fighter-ii-the-new-challengers/3030-20976/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20976\"> <b>Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers</b></a></h3><p>Making the transition to CP System II arcade hardware in October 1993, Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers introduced four new characters and new gameplay changes to the other twelve characters. Each character now has eight palettes, which is selectable by either pressing one of the six attack buttons, or by holding start and pressing a punch or kick button. The announcer and several characters have new voices. The game also has new background artwork, a brand new intro sequence, and a new scoring system that rewards multi-hit combos, first attacks, and reversals. The gameplay speed, however, is about as slow as Street Fighter II': Champion Edition.</p><h3><a href=\"/super-street-fighter-ii-turbo/3030-1251/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1251\"> <b>Super Street Fighter II Turbo</b></a></h3><p>Known in Japan as Super Street Fighter II X: Grand Master Challenge, the game (released in April 1994) is a faster version of Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers (with some cabinets allowing players to select the game's speed) while introducing gameplay mechanics and abilities, such as Super Combos. Like Street Fighter II': Hyper Fighting, each player's primary color palette is changed, and the only way to access the original color palette is by accessing the Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers version of the character (with no Super Combos and character changes) via special cheat codes. Along with new abilities for each character, this version of Street Fighter II also introduced juggling, throw escapes, and Super Combos, and is considered to be the most competitive Street Fighter II game worldwide. The game also introduces the secret boss Akuma, built from Electronic Gaming Monthly's April Fools rumor of a hidden boss named Sheng Long. If certain requirements are met in the single-player mode, he will confront the player instead of M. Bison.</p><h3><a href=\"/hyper-street-fighter-ii-the-anniversary-edition/3030-14918/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14918\"> <b>Hyper Street Fighter II: The Anniversary Edition</b></a></h3><p>Released in December 2003, nearly 10 years after Super Street Fighter II Turbo, for Japan, Southeast Asia, and limited USA arcade markets, Hyper Street Fighter II: The Anniversary Edition builds upon Super Street Fighter II Turbo by adding the ability to select character iterations from previous Street Fighter II games. (Normal, Champ/Dash, Turbo, Super, and Super T/Super X) Characters could only pick the iterations that they were playable in (for example, Cammy could not pick Normal, Champ/Dash, or Turbo modes).</p><h2>Characters</h2><p>The original release of Street Fighter II featured eight playable characters and four unplayable bosses.

When it touched the tar, it rose from the Pit of Hate and became known as Aku. The Emperor was guided by Odin's horse in which the three gods as monks forged a sword out of the Emperor's spirit to kill Aku. After defeating Aku, the Samurai Lord banished Aku in the form of a tree. At the same time, his son was born. In response, the Emperor decided to make a plan if Aku returns.</p><h3>Aku's Return</h3><p>Less than a decade later, Aku was freed by an eclipse. The Emperor sent his son to train in different places on Earth until he became 25. When he returned to Japan, the prince realized that Aku and his demons enslaved his people. The prince got his father's sword back and almost killed Aku at the pit of Hate. Before he could finish Aku, Aku sent the prince to the future.</p><h3>The Future</h3><p>In the future, Aku hired a group of scientists to build an army of robots: The X-Models. All but one of them got destroyed which is X9, an X-Model with an emotion chip. In response, the scientists created the Beetle Drones. With the Beetle Drones, Aku transformed Earth into a free planet by bringing aliens from different planets.

The Autolog was designed to keep players up to date on what their friends are up to in the game, and would show any records set by them.
