Your objective is to escape. Plot is secondary as both games start with the same premise. There is no spoken dialogue (apart from one liners which come out of your character's mouth from time to time) and killing scientists does not have any impact on the game's plot. The games present themselves under a cartoony art style and pushes the player to destroy as many objects as possible and to kill scientists. Scientists die in horrible grotesque ways but thanks to the cartoony feel of the game, none of the death is shocking. Scientists can be disintegrated, decapitated or have their throat slit. Despite this harsh punishment, there is no blood, as meat bursts out of the scientist's wounds. The game's plot is sometimes told through FMV cutscenes starring the game's developers.</p><p>The 'Splosion Man games are at heart platformers. Only you do not jump, you explode from platform to platform. Your character can do up to three different explosions in a row before he has to recharge. Recharging can be done by not exploding, which means you can recharge while running or while sliding down walls. Apart from exploding, your character can only do one other thing: commit suicide. Every button on the controller is used to explode except for left trigger which is used to kill yourself. Your goal is to guide your little exploding buddy to the level's exit while avoiding obstacles such as lasers and robots that can only be killed from behind. The games also feature boss fights at the end of each world.</p><h2>Difference Between the Two</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/112517/1820256-mssplosionman.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1820256\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.56166666666667\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/112517/1820256-mssplosionman.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1820256\"><img alt=\"Ms. Splosion Man splodes into action!\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/112517/1820256-mssplosionman.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/11/112517/1820256-mssplosionman.jpg 600w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/112517/1820256-mssplosionman.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/112517/1820256-mssplosionman.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Ms. Splosion Man splodes into action!</figcaption></figure><p>Released in 2009, the original 'Splosion Man had players control <a data-ref-id=\"3005-11820\" href=\"/splosion-man/3005-11820/\" slug=\"splosion-man\">'Splosion Man</a>, a lab experiment gone wrong more focused on eating cakes than escaping. 2 years later, Ms. Splosion Man was released and had you play as a lady experiment who seemed more focused on shoes than escaping.
