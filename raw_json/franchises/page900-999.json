Similar to most of their previous titles, Artifical Girl drops the player on a beautiful tropical island along with a female companion to interact with. The player is asked to customize the female character to his personal tastes, including traits such as hair color, eye color, height, shape and, of course, breast size, and is then given free-will to do what he pleases.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>The \"goal\" of games in the series is to have both the player's avatar and the female character climax during intercourse, increasing your friendship with her. Other mundane tasks performed by the female character can be spectated as well as interacting with her through various ways on the many locations found on the islands. Unlike most other 'dating' sims, Artificial Girl only has one female character to interact with and there is no backstory or plot to encourage the player. However, the modding community and fans of Illusion's works have still kept the series afloat despite it's\u00a0criticisms.\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3715/548042-20071205094116468fn2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-548042\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3715/548042-20071205094116468fn2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-548042\"><img alt=\"I wonder what this could mean\u00a0\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/3715/548042-20071205094116468fn2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/3715/548042-20071205094116468fn2.jpg 600w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/3715/548042-20071205094116468fn2.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>I wonder what this could mean\u00a0</figcaption></figure>     One of the biggest criticisms held against the series, however, is the lack of true customization.

Developed by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-523\" href=\"/audiogenic-software-ltd/3010-523/\" slug=\"audiogenic-software-ltd\">Audiogenic Software Ltd.</a> and published by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-491\" href=\"/codemasters/3010-491/\" slug=\"codemasters\">Codemasters</a>, the game was re-released the following year for the <span>Sega Mega Drive</span> (Genesis in the United States) and Commodore Amiga. The game proved to be a success in the United Kingdom, spending ten weeks at the top of the games charts over the summer. This was probably due to the amount of content the game offered; players were able to choose from a One-Day International or a Test match, and offered multiplayer support for up to four players. In 1996, the franchise released its second game in the form of Brian Lara Cricket '96. This updated version featured squad updates for that year's cricket season, as well as including the ability to play as English county teams.<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4011/514522-blc2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-514522\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.7515923566879\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.2%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4011/514522-blc2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-514522\"><img alt=\"Brian Lara Cricket '99 was the series' first 3D release\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/4011/514522-blc2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/4011/514522-blc2.jpg 314w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px\" data-width=\"314\"></a><figcaption>Brian Lara Cricket '99 was the series' first 3D release</figcaption></figure>The series moved into full 3D for the first time with its third title, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-5810\" href=\"/brian-lara-cricket-99/3030-5810/\" slug=\"brian-lara-cricket-99\">Brian Lara Cricket '99</a>. Developed and published by Codemasters, the game was released on PC and Sony's PlayStation console in 1998. Besides the obvious change to three-dimensional graphics, BLC99 was recognised for its use of in-game <span>commentary</span>. The game offered a multitude of new modes to players beyond the ODI and Test matches; the option to play a Friendly match was added, as was the chance to practise using the game's Net Training feature. Among the other new game modes were the World Cup and World Challenge modes (both different kinds of One-Day International tournaments) and the Test Season, which allowed players to embark on up to seven years of touring Test matches with the nation of their choice. Perhaps the most notable additions, though, were the classic matches; famous scenarios from the sport's past, challenging the player to either repeat or rewrite cricket history by completing challenges. The game was marketed as Shane Warne Cricket in Australia.<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/346840-ss_14.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-346840\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/346840-ss_14.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-346840\"><img alt=\"Brian Lara International Cricket 2005 added Hawkeye ball tracking to the series\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/56/346840-ss_14.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/56/346840-ss_14.jpg 640w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/56/346840-ss_14.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Brian Lara International Cricket 2005 added Hawkeye ball tracking to the series</figcaption></figure>The next Brian Lara game did not see release for another seven years. <a data-ref-id=\"3030-13430\" href=\"/brian-lara-international-cricket-2005/3030-13430/\" slug=\"brian-lara-international-cricket-2005\">Brian Lara International Cricket 2005</a> was developed by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-4277\" href=\"/swordfish-studios-limited/3010-4277/\" slug=\"swordfish-studios-limited\">Swordfish Studios</a> and released for PlayStation 2, Xbox and PC on July 21st 2005 - the first day of that year's Ashes series. It stayed faithful to its predecessor in terms of gameplay, instead focusing on refining the existing features and bringing some new ones to the table. The most obvious of these is the inclusion of the Hawkeye ball tracking system within the game, giving players another means to explore the statistical aspect of the sport. Unlike the three games before it, BLIC2005 did not feature full licensing for all of its game modes. While the 2003 World Cup and 2004 Champions Trophy featured licensed players, kits and stadia, the remainder of its modes contained players with misspelt names similar to those found in the early <a data-ref-id=\"3025-596\" href=\"/pro-evolution-soccer/3025-596/\" slug=\"pro-evolution-soccer\">Pro Evolution Soccer</a> games. As well as the aforementioned tournaments, BLIC2005 featured ODI and Test match modes, a new roster of classic matches and a simplistic player editing suite. The game featured a lot of unlockable content, including a Classic XI team featuring notable names from the sport's past including W.G. Grace and Donald Bradman.

As with BLIC2005, the game lacks full licensing, which is once again restricted to the World Cup and Champions Trophy modes. The game also lacks the classic matches present in the series' last two incarnations. In their place is the ability to create a custom team of up to 15 original players and online play for the X360 and PC versions of the game.

The first game also features several vehicle sections and the second features some turret sections.</p><p>Combat is a mixture of both <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/third-person-perspective/3015-464/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-464\">third-person</a> shooting and simple <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/hand-to-hand-combat/3015-288/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-288\">hand-to-hand combat</a> mechanics. The shooting takes place from an <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/over-the-shoulder/3015-2621/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2621\">over-the-shoulder</a> view that can be compared to games like <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/resident-evil-4/3030-1578/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1578\">Resident Evil 4</a> and <a href=\"/gears-of-war/3025-565/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-565\">Gears of War</a>, using weapons varying from <a href=\"/crossbow/3055-107/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-107\">crossbows</a> to <a href=\"/rocket-launcher/3055-211/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-211\">RPGs</a>. It also uses a cover system, like <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/killswitch/3030-1152/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1152\">Kill Switch</a> and Gears of War.

Actors for Uncharted use motion-capture to act out the scenes as well as provided the dialogue at the same time which is relatively uncommon is gaming. The script writing process for the games is also unique in that actors will rehearse and perform together with a certain amount of openness in the script. This means the games feature a lot of improvisation, leading to some of the best one-liners in video game history.</p><p> </p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><p>The Uncharted games both have soundtracks composed by television composer Greg Edmonson.

You control your horde of minions.\u00a0 Send them forward, or \"sweep\" them, and they will react based on what you send them towards.\u00a0 If you send them towards turnstiles, they will turn it, to open a door or gate. Send them towards enemies or breakable items, and they will attack (gleefully shouting \"DESTROY!\" as they do).\u00a0 They will return to you with any potions or gold they find, while\u00a0 weapons or armor, they will keep for themselves, to increase their attack and defensive power. Of the four types of minions (see details below), these items will be visible on the Browns only, but they affect Reds, Greens and Blues as well, though to a lesser degree. <br/>\u00a0\u00a0 <br/>In addition to sending and sweeping, you can place your minions on a guard marker, represented by a flag. Minions on a guard marker will stay put until you recall them, but they will attack any enemies that approach the marker. Guard markers can be moved directly, which is useful for defending a choke point, but -- since minions automatically return if you stop sweeping them -- is also necessary for certain puzzles which require precise timing.<br/><br/><h3>Brown Minions </h3>Browns are your melee fighters, and make up the bulk of your horde.\u00a0 They have no immunities, but do have better defense and more direct attack power than the other types.<br/>\u00a0<br/><h3>Red Minions </h3>Reds serve as ranged fighters, throwing fireballs at enemies, which have a change to light them on fire.\u00a0 They are immune to fire, and can extinguish burning objects.\u00a0 Reds are much more aggressive when placed on a guard marker. A common tactic is to place them on a marker on high ground, out of direct danger.<br/>\u00a0<br/><h3>Green Minions </h3>Greens are stealth fighters.\u00a0 While they are stronger than Reds or Blues, they are weaker than Browns, and while they are somewhat effective in a direct fight, it is more effective to sweep them behind enemies so they can use their backstab attack.\u00a0 Placing them on a guard marker causes them to turn nearly invisible, which is useful for setting up ambushes.\u00a0 Greens are immune to poison.<br/>\u00a0<br/><h3>Blue Minions </h3>Blue minions are extremely weak, and should never be used as melee fighters -- at least against creatures that can fight back.\u00a0 Their primary purpose is as priests: they can revive fallen minions.\u00a0 They are also the only minions that can swim.", "guid": "3025-1010", "name": "Overlord"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-1011", "name": "Manhunter"}, {"description": null, "guid": "3025-1012", "name": "Two Worlds"}, {"description": "<p>The series follows <a href=\"/lo-wang/3005-187/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-187\">Lo Wang</a>, a master <a href=\"/ninja/3015-12/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-12\">ninja</a> <a href=\"/assassin/3015-1321/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1321\">assassin</a>, that has had creatures sent after him after quitting his job as a bodyguard for Zilla Enterprises.
